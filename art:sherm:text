Ish:
	You said you liked me! Why not!
Sherma:
	??
Ish:
	Go check your tinder app (mine is gone) you will see that you wrote to me 'I like you' --- your words not mine!
	Maybe it slipped but you said it !!! Sherma likes Artie...... Sherma like Artie .... K I S S I N G..... Do I need to finish the song lol!!!
Sherma:
	Finish it 
Ish:
	First comes love then comes marriage then comes lil artie in a baby carriage sucking his thumb wetting his pants doing the hula hula dance !!
	It goes something like that if your fortunate to meet me I'll sing it in person 
Sherma:
	I think I got it from here, thank you 
Ish:
	You are very welcome! Thanks for getting me off tinder! You are the best!
	You've changed my life!
Sherma:
	Shut up 
	Did you have to select and paste for all the tinder matches this same line 
	lol 
Ish:
	Nope not all their names were Sherma so I leave blank spaces to fill in the names 
Sherma:
	But I'm your lady 
Ish:
	Without a doubt
	Wild horses couldn't keep me away!!
Sherma:
	Only another female will :)
	Or male. I pass no judgements 
Ish:
	Are you jealous?
Sherma:
	Psssh, hell no 
	I'm actually encouraging you to go for it 
Ish:
	I told you I deleted the app. I only have eyes for you Sherma! 
	Would you please tell me again that you like me! It makes me happier ( since I'm already happy like you )!
Sherma:
	Artie I think I like you 
Ish:
	Think or know?
Sherma:
	I kindda feeling you at the moment 
	Don't push it buddy 
Ish:
	At the moment you feeling me is it taking your breath away?
Sherma:
	I have breathing problems 
	When I think of you I throw caution to the wind 
	And I'm like fuck it, this is the guy I like 
	He tinder guy who deleted his app for me 
	The
	And address me as "my lady"
	Was that good?? 
Ish:
	The best!
	Was any of it true?
Sherma:
	Yes . My kind sir, are you calling me a liar ?
Ish:
	Never my lady
Sherma:
	Oka, or else you would be banished or sent to the dungeon 
	Can I get to some serious questions ?
Ish:
	Of course
Sherma:
	So you have any psychological issues ?  Y / N 
	Have you ever been convicted 
Ish:
	Nope 
Sherma:
	??
Ish:
	Convicted of what?
Sherma:
	Of any crimes / serve time ?
Ish:
	No psychological issue
	Can I answer these questions in person?
Sherma:
	You have something more important to do ??
Ish:
	You are of the upmost importance! Figure you might not like my answers rather give bad news in person! üò§
Sherma:
	I like honest answers , don't care if it's bad or not 
Ish:
	I have been convicted of Dwi
Sherma:
	Did you hurt anyone driving under the influence ?
	Okay I guess you don't want to talk about it 
Ish:
	I did have an accident I was driving my A4 and someone cut me off and I totaled my car and theirs even though I don't cause the accident I refused a breathalyzer so in the law eyes I was guilty! The driver wasn't killed but did sue for injuries and was given some $ by my insurance and case is closed civilly and I had to spend a few month in Nassau county corrections probably the main reason why me and my wife separated! I had to resign from my job as well I had for 10 years at cablevision . That's why I decided to do a career change with the web developing I mentioned in my first post to you which you criticized me as too much information at the moment! I hope this is honest enough for you my lady!!!
Sherma:
	I appreciate the honesty. Thank you 
Ish:
	Should I delete your number now?
Sherma:
	No 
	I don't like lies, I rather hear the worse possible truth than to be lied too 
Ish:
	So I'm not beneath you? Your not out of my league?
	It's very strange and difficult  to tell someone you don't too well your biggest regret but if you can accept that from me the worst is over I suppose üôè
	*don't know too well **
	Unfortunately I'm not perfect ..... 
	We still twins now?
Sherma:
	Please do fuck up shit all the time, doesn't make them a bad person, just bad decision 
	We still twinning 
Ish:
	Sooo even though I'm not perfect I could still be perfect for you?
Sherma:
	Whatever you do, always start with yourself being 1st 
	You have to be good enough for you 
Ish:
	That's not a problem for me being alone for a while I've learned to accept myself
	My son is tied for 1st, ok?
	File Transfer: IMG_0680.jpeg
	And my puppy lol!!
	The 3 musketeers !!
	If you play your cards right maybe you can be the 4th musketeer !!!
	File Transfer: IMG_7068.jpeg
Sherma:
	Family comes 1st, always 
Ish:
	File Transfer: IMG_0425.jpeg

Sherma:
	It's cute 
	Stay involved in your sons life 
Ish:
	File Transfer: IMG_4376.jpeg
	Told you his mom is Indian can you tell ?
Sherma:
	100%
Ish:
	Do you have any children (beside surrogates)?
Sherma:
	I got 2 daughters . Had them in my early 20's
	Married when I was 20, way too young 
	Naive and thought love would last forever 
	Sadly nothing does except the love for your children and family 
Ish:
	Better to have lost at love then to never love at all they say ! 
	Is that why you wanna break my heart ?
Sherma:
	I'm. It the kind of person who's intentionally hurt others 
	Meant I'm not 
Ish:
	Just have a big ego and being sarcastic I get it! 
	I'll proceed with caution. Lol ! I'm sure you will as well!
Sherma:
	Hash people are the most sensitive, don't you know that 
	Harsh 
Ish:
	I didn't think of you as harsh! Hope you don't think I am! Easy going as they come I promise!
	I don't take things too seriously especially myself
Sherma:
	I like the fact that you have as good as you got 
	Wasn't harsh:)
	I like the fact that you gave as good as you got 
	I don't like pushovers, a challenge can be quite intriguing 
Ish:
	So is that another admission from you that 'you like me' ?
Sherma:
	Like is more important than love, it takes time 
	But I'm def interested 
Ish:
	Likewise emphasis on like!!
Sherma:
	People say I love you all the time but if I don't like who you are, I can't love you 
Ish:
	Understood! We will go slow good things come to those who wait remember ?üòç :).  We can just start at making love first then worry bout the big L , ok my lady ?
Sherma:
	It was a general statement my lord 
Ish:
	Ok! Just following your lead!
	Does your crystal ball see any future for us?
Sherma:
	No se
Ish:
	Crystal ball still cloudy?
Sherma:
	Don't know what the future holds but I've learnt that the best made plans are laid to rest 
	So I enjoy each day with the people I care about 
Ish:
	You don't believe you have a hand in your future ? Not one of those 'life is what you make it!"
	Does your Crystal ball show when we will first meet?
Sherma:
	Soon!!! , date looks cloudy 
	But promising 
Ish:
	Great! I don't like pushovers, a challenge can be quite intriguing 
Sherma:
	It's gonna be difficult with my size too, lol 
Ish:
	No problem!
	Do you have any other tough questions for me?
Sherma:
	Is their any reconciliation bet you and your wife ? 
	The possibility ??
Ish:
	We made an agreement if I don't meet anyone by next week we will reconcile if not its over . So you have one week to make up your mind if you wanna see me , ok? 
	No pressure!
Sherma:
	Zero pressure , it's good that you two would do it to keep the family together 
Ish:
	No chance of reconciliation if there was I wouldn't waste your time or mine or anyone others for that matter!
	I know my powers wouldn't end well if there was a possibility I like my parts were they are !
Sherma:
	Okay but it's def worth the effort is all am saying 
Ish:
	You wanna be my lady or my counselor ? ü§î
Sherma:
	Both, is that a problem ??
Ish:
	Not at all the secret behind any good man is a better woman!
	We been together since 1999 it's ran its course . Things end badly or they wouldn't end at all. We are both great parents tho! Could be worse I suppose !
	Where are we going to on our 1st date?
Sherma:
	I'm a vegetarian, that's something you should know about me 
Ish:
	A 200lb vegetarian omg lol!!!üò±üò±üò±
Sherma:
	Yea ?? And ??
Ish:
	I can't wait to meet!
	Soooo again, Where are we going to on our 1st date?
Sherma:

Ish:
	You like roti?
Sherma:
	Once per month 
	You cracking me up here 
	Stop 
Ish:
	Cmon !! You like black pudding?
Sherma:
	I'm vegetarian 
Ish:
	Black pudding isn't meat
Sherma:
	It's from the blood of an animal 
	Even more gross 
Ish:
	Really didn't know that never had it -- alway looked like rice in a sausage casing 
	You eat fish?
Sherma:
	It's from pigs blood. Eewh 
Ish:
	Gross I agree -- you do fish? Shrimp?
Sherma:
	Neither but I promise myself that I'm gonna try fish this year 
Ish:
	Will that be before or after we meet?
Sherma:
	Probably after 
Ish:
	So I'll see you this year??
Sherma:
	Yup, I like Olive Garden, Benihana 
	Nobu in the city 
	I love Thai food 
Ish:
	You know what I like!!
Sherma:
	Indian ??
Ish:
	I love Indian!!!
	Only vegetarian Indian tho!
Sherma:
	Good answer 
Ish:
	When you get the courage to meet me we can go to any of those places if you want!
	I told you I'm easy! 
Sherma:
	Then you won't be a challenge  :(
Ish:
	If you know what you want why make things difficult!
	Believe me I'm not proposing or anything just a 1st date!
Sherma:
	What do you want and why do you want it ?
Ish:
	I want a 1st date with you so why make it difficult! Do I want a second? That will be answered some time this year I suppose( when you have the guts)!! You apparently have 1 gut so finding more hopefully won't take too longüò¥üò¥üò¥
Sherma:
	That I do have, lots of belly 
	Okay but
	How about sometime next week ?
Ish:
	In answer to your question ! I don't know what I want from you that's intriguing and the why is because we've spoken for quite a while and I haven't scared you away and you seem to get my humor which is two big checks in your favor ! That I do mean!
Sherma:
	Too soon for you ?
Ish:
	Whenever , wherever? You claim to like spontaneity but need a week to prepare for me, lol!! Damn you must really like me üë©‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüíã‚Äçüë©üë©‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüíã‚Äçüë©üë©‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüíã‚Äçüë©
	Awwwww!! Good for you! Trust your instincts ! They are right on with me!
Sherma:
	Get dress. Let's do it tonight 
	You like being spontaneous 
Ish:
	I know in my dreams !! Lol!
Sherma:
	I'm talking about food, get your mind out of the gutter !!
Ish:
	I'm not in gutter! You said that earlier lol!
	Remember made a hint about meeting tonite then said in my dream
Sherma:
	You were trying to seduce me then 
Ish:
	I'm always trying to seduce you doesn't mean it'll happen lol!!
	Actually you've been trying to seduce me I thought lol!! 
Sherma:
	Get outta here 
	You would know it if I did . 
Ish:
	Believe me I don't expect anything! Just happy we're getting along to be honest ! I don't have a habit of getting too excited and getting my hopes up!
	It's tough to seduce anyone through texts IMHO 
	More for laughing and fact finding IMO 
	When I see you in person and I'm "feeling you" then I'll bring my A game! This is fun but tempered enthusiasm üòé
	You honestly "ain't seen nothing yet"!
Sherma:
	Talking bout my ego !! There's no place to check yours 
Ish:
	There is a difference between confidence and arrogance when we meet you will learn the difference!! üòò
Sherma:
	Dude l invented confidence 
Ish:
	And you say I have an ego smh?
	You go girl!!
Sherma:
	If you look it up it will have my name next to it 
Ish:
	I did and that's where I found your #!
	I'm getting dressed where we gonna meet?
Sherma:
	Somewhere in the middle ? 
Ish:
	Seriously?
Sherma:
	File Transfer: IMG_2509.png
	I'll ready. Wearing this 
	I'm 
Ish:
	You won't be wearing it too long if we do meet ‚ö°Ô∏è! Wow!!
Sherma:
	You like the dress ?
	Me too 
Ish:
	I do ! Very classy! 
Sherma:
	Depends on the date. I'm a jeans girls too 
	But alway heels 
Ish:
	How tall are you in heels?
Sherma:
	Am 5'3
Ish:
	We are the same height maybe we are twins!
Sherma:
	And I wear 5-6 inch heels 
Ish:
	That's fine you sure you aren't 300 lbs or does the camera normally add that much weight? üòúüòú
Sherma:
	It's all me 200 and not 300. Damn I'm not that heavy
Ish:
	I know just kidding ! Like I was kidding about being 5'3
	I'm 5'8 and a quarter
Sherma:
	And I'm actually 115 lbs 
	A quarter ?? What's that 
Ish:
	I'd guess 120 it's ok to fudge a bit 
Sherma:
	Okay to be exact it's 115.7
Ish:
	Quarter inch lol!! Don't you know by now that women lie about pounds and men lie about inches 
	Most men and women anyway!
Sherma:
	So true 
Ish:
	Fortunately for me (maybe you someday) I never found the need to lie !
Sherma:
	Yea I'm not big on forgiving when it comes to lies 
	It's just who I am 
Ish:
	You lied to me about your weight? Lol I forgive you . Cost you one but when we meet, ok?
	One hug
Sherma:
	Psssh yeah right !!!
Ish:
	No hug?
	But = hug
Sherma:
	No , we not tight like that 
Ish:
	If you say so! I'm not so stingy with my hugs
Sherma:
	Lol , good for you 
Ish:
	Can I get a handshake when we meet then?
Sherma:
	Yea I can do that 
Ish:
	No hug then not looking good to meet tonite,Getting late anyway and you were just bluffing me anyway 
Sherma:
	Got somewhere to go ? 
Ish:
	Nope
Sherma:
	Why are you home on a Friday nite?
Ish:
	I know in that dress you sure got somewhere to go, lol!!
Sherma:
	And not chillin w friends 
Ish:
	No plans! I'm kinda past those days !
	I will go out with you ... But the whole friends things that's pretty much non existent these days
Sherma:
	Y??
Ish:
	Not in a celebratory mood still got things in my life I gotta fix!
	I hope that doesn't scare you! 
	We can have a long talk bout it over a nice meal or something if you like! 
	One day when your ready and feel comfortable!
	Vegetarian meal of course!
Sherma:
	I'm not scared of you, I always have pepper spray 
	And taser 
Ish:
	Then i definitely won't hug you!
	Screw the handshake too maybe just a wave hi will work!
Sherma:
	Lmao 
	Play it safe 
Ish:
	Exactly that's why no more friends notes
	Nights
	Guy friends nights I mean 
	You and me friends night is ok 
Sherma:
	I think that could work 
	I think I would like to go out w you for real 
Ish:
	Thank you! That would be nice. 
	Sounds nice anyway! Hopefully if I'm in the friends zone it won't be for too long!
Sherma:
	Shut up 
Ish:
	I only know 1 way lol!!
Sherma:
	I bet 
Ish:
	Time will tell I suppose!
Sherma:
	It's a date, if there's any chemistry we do it again 
	If not I've gained a friend 
	And I love football 
Ish:
	Me too! Maybe we are twins !
Sherma:
	From another mother 
Ish:
	Do you believe in incest?
Sherma:
	Wtf 
Ish:
	Meaning if we are twins then we can't be together 
	Ohh another mother doesn't mean same father misunderstood 
	Bad joke!! I have a few from time to time 
	If there isn't any chemistry on our date joke will be on me !
	If there wasn't chemistry on my end I'd never ask for your number or ask you out for that matter lol!
Sherma:
	So what you're saying is that you're feeling me ?
Ish:
	Or reply to your texts immediately! Only reason I reply to your texts immediately is cuz I want you to know how quick my mind works prepare you for me! So you don't think this is scripted or I'm obsessed thinking of the perfect answer 
	I will answer thay question when I see you! Feeling is a visual and emotional thing for me that is best expressed in 3D IMO!
	My actions would suggest that 'yes' I'm feeling you!
	If it is true in person why ruin the moment with a corny text agreed?
Sherma:
	Agreed 
Ish:
	I am good admit it?
Sherma:
	You're okay 
Ish:
	Too bad texting is cheap the real fun starts when we lock eyes üíî
	Then we shall see! Can't wait lol! Let me know when your ready Freddy 
Sherma:
	Born ready, 
	Been ready 
	Am ready 
Ish:
	For a handshake whoppeee 
Sherma:
	What ??
Ish:
	Ready to give me a handshake...... Not even a hug cmon!!
Sherma:
	You spent a lot of time w me today so yea a hug might suffice 
Ish:
	I'm not asking for sex just a lil show of affection
Sherma:
	And you weren't getting any sex .!!
	You could ask but it doesn't mean shit
Ish:
	You are something else! I get the whole challenge but you still feel the need to not only close the door but lock it and padlock it too!
	I understand thanks for the clarification! And the cold shower and ice bucket over the head as well
Sherma:
	If you know anything about Trini's , there's a saying . If you get thru the front, kick in de back door 
	Don't get carried away. Still take that cold shower 
Ish:
	You ever kiss on 1st date?
Sherma:
	I have before but I knew him for a few months prior to
Ish:
	Understood! We've covered about a month today ! That's good news
	I like my chances
Sherma:
	Depends on whether there's crazy chemistry 
Ish:
	How about tomorrow? It's late most restaurants closing soon anyway
	Crazy is my middle name now loving my chances Sherma!!
Sherma:
	Kissing is a platform for me to continue or discontinue a relationship 
Ish:
	Kiss goodbye in my case probably ! 
Sherma:
	Are you a terrible kisser ?
Ish:
	You know the answer already to that lol! Best question you've asked me brought a true smile to my face üòã
	I guess you'll have to take a gamble and find out üòòüòòüòò
Sherma:
	I guess so 
Ish:
	I'm sure you'll let me know afterwards 
Sherma:
	Sometimes this year works for you ??
Ish:
	Please before my fingers start to bleed from all this texting
Sherma:
	Small sacrifice 
Ish:
	What do you find most attractive in a guy? You didn't write a bio and normally the less I know about a woman the better but that true smile before making me a bit curious?
	Most attractive or any qualities you find attractive is fine as well Sherma !
	This way I can tailor my bs just for you my lady!
Sherma:
	Sense of humor, playfulness , honestly . Being able to apologize . Wanting to slow dance even when there's no music playing 
	Being sincere. Moral and ethical 
	Just a few, lol 
Ish:
	Get that first kiss before the 1st appetizer! Cuz I know after it happens and I knock your socks off your still gonna downplay it and say it was alright while your knees swag lol
Sherma:
	Things that cost nothing are most precious to me 
Ish:
	I'm sorry I didn't wake you up the last two days ! Or we could've maybe spent some time together sooner! For what it's worth when I was serenading you earlier with the K I S S I N G song I was slow dancing with my iPhone! I believe that killing whales is morally wrong as well as hunting animals for sport!
	I have been honest about my convictions!
	Have I checked them all off yet?
Sherma:
	Partially there 
	Good start 
Ish:
	And I think it's ethically important to be honest with your partner and lover!
	And on our first date you can pay so it will cost me nothing , deal? 
Sherma:
	Deal 
Ish:
	Of course! 
Sherma:
	Do you need to be notified in advance if I were to ask you out ?? 
Ish:
	Depends? Will there be more then handshakes?
Sherma:
	NAh 
Ish:
	There's another thing you should probably know about me that's a negative! 
	It has to do with my conviction and such!
Sherma:
	Go ahead 
Ish:
	I don't have a drivers license! I could get it but at this time don't feel the need!
	I get around just fine usually! But it's the main obstacle why I didn't push harder too meet you halfway tonite
	Otherwise you might've been in trouble tonite
Sherma:
	üôÑ whatever 
Ish:
	Puh-lease Sherma can't find Mother Nature!! 
	Good luck with that!
Sherma:
	You wanna go into the city 
Ish:
	Sure! Anywhere is fine with me
	Again, I'm easy Richmond hill is fine. There's a bennihanna in westbury 
	I'm sure you've been there it's right next to an Olive Garden as well
Sherma:
	I dislike this. area with a passion 
Ish:
	Anywhere u like! And I'll pay don't worry!
Sherma:
	I hold my own 
Ish:
	Not anymore
	Let me hold mine and you hold me or it's gonna be a real short story lol!!
	It's the ethical and moral thing to do !
	Honest thing as well I'm sorry to say!!
Sherma:
	My fav words are , shut up, fuck and wtf 
Ish:
	Sorry again just trying to be funny and playful with you my lady!
Sherma:
	Non offensive so never take it personal 
Ish:
	I don't just following your guidelines of attractiveness thought you'd catch that Sherma
Sherma:
	Just saying 
Ish:
	Amazing your fav words are my favorite actions !!!
Sherma:

	I'm a sucker for dimples. My knees quiver 
Ish:
	Now I know your drunk! 
	That was the cold weather you silly willy! 
	Besides showing up like you did and spending time with me was reward enough!
Sherma:
	I was actually thinking about getting you a lg vanilla shake from Haagen Dazs ( reward)
Ish:
	Done that already .... Now who's the one being predictable 
Sherma:
	You always do it twice with the person you like 
	Where are you from , don't you know that ?
Ish:
	Twice in same night yes! Unless I'm gonna see you in next hour and 10 mins not same my lady
	So your admitting again you like me or is that the angry orchard speaking ?
	Night  doesn't equal day so you have until sunrise actually my bad
Sherma:
	Yup, angry Orchard is def coaxing me on :) 
	I wanna go take a hot bubble bath and then go to bed 
	So thanks again for today

Sherma:

	Hope you enjoyed your day off fwiw I did think about you once or twice.
Sherma:
	Yesterday was my daughters bday.. One of her request is me not being on my phone :) So I left it at home 
Ish:
	Wtf?
Sherma:
	I guess ur well? 
	No need to ask how u doing ?
Ish:
	Awwww!!! Mrs. Discipline at it again. Kudos to you!
	No meat no kisses no phone - The holy trinity of Discipline with a hint of stubbornness!!
Sherma:
	Shut up, you're just  a hater and don't have the same discipline as I do 
Ish:
	I'm giving you a compliment (kudos) how's that hating ? I'll never hate you
	Or hate on you for that matter not my style
	I'm a lover not a hater!üòò
	üòç
Sherma:
	With your overflowing of emotions, it wasn't difficult at all to see that quality in you 
	I'm getting dress for work, leaving in a few 
Ish:
	3 reasons or rules Mrs discipline (my lady) invoked  
1. Just food
2. 0 expectations
3. Was wearing her chastity belt!!!üòÇüò§üôÑüò∑
	That's why I kept my emotions intact! It was following your lead and acting Appropriately, figured you couldn't handle anything more üòú
Sherma:
	Locked and padlocked  lol you need to worry about yourself if you can't keep up 
	Will try and touch base with you later 
Ish:
	Enjoy your day thanks for not deleting my number yet and for the advice!  I'll work on my lock picking skills in the meantime my lady!
Sherma:
	Tenks Tenks 
	We're twins. Won't delete ur number 
	Your in the fam zone 
Ish:
	Awesome!! If fam was an acronym for
	F‚Ä¶k
	Artie
	manana
	Then we‚Äôd be twins!!
	However knowing you already as well as I do‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs a zone right before‚Ä¶..I‚Äôd rather kiss a frog!  
Sherma:
	Was about to say, You could dream baby 
	"En tus sue√±os" 
Ish:
	Whatever zone I‚Äôm in is perfect. As long as your with me to reject me no other place I‚Äôd rather be.  You said slowly and I‚Äôm fine with that my lady!
	Better this way anyway. It‚Äôs perfect. No way any woman alive who hasn‚Äôt had meat in 40 years could handle me anyway!!!üçî
Sherma:
	You should tap out, your ego is overpowering you 
Ish:
	Right after you my lady!
	Ladies first!
Sherma:
	Oh no your grace, I insist 
	A lady follows her lord 
Ish:
	"En tus sue√±os"
	Honestly, the only thing overpowering is your bull! My lady.
	üáπüáπ
Sherma:
	You're hilarious today. Aren't you ?? Did you not mention something about  wanting to be on a bull. Psssh 
Ish:
	I can't wait to ride the bull üò£
Sherma:
	Financial district, ride away 
	My twin 
Ish:
	üò©
	 I agree  the only bull that could probably handle me 
Sherma:
	That's so gay 
	No judgement here pal 
	If that's how you like to ride I'm cool with
It 
Ish:
	Not all jokes work but you get the point why sooo petty 
Sherma:
	My best friends are gay, I live them more than my straight friends 
Ish:
	Sooo what should my expectations be for our second date ? Still zero?
Sherma:
	Love 
	Whoa ??
	There's a 2nd date ?
Ish:
	I'm keeping my fingers crossed 
Sherma:
	Should cross our legs also. It like help :) and pray 
Ish:
	You don't give an inch do you smh 
	You did enough leg crossing on our 1st date didn't think it was needed
	Did enough leg crossing for the both of us my lady and twin 
Sherma:
	Don't you have to be someplace ?
Ish:
	Yes on train now my lady
Sherma:
	I don't get why women aren't tripping over to be with you. Damn you're such a catch, Mey lord 
Ish:
	Still drinking angry orchard I see smh
Sherma:
	Don't need it when I'm around you, cuz your so bubbly I could barely contain myself 
Ish:
	Sure fooled me sister Theresa
	Fwiw "contain yourself" from what exactly?
Sherma:
	Morning mey lord 
	Greeting 
	How all is well 
Ish:
	Thanks ! It means a lot wishing me a good morning 3 minutes before afternoon
	Nothing like waiting to the last minute maybe we are twins!
Sherma:
	When do you not complain? Damn , we are twins 
Ish:
	Just trying to speak your language
Sherma:
	It wasn't 11.59 am tho 
	Spoken well my friend 
	No need to try 
Ish:
	That's my lady queen of petty showing back up üò©
	Back to yesterday again, can you clarify what you meant by "barely contain myself"
Sherma:
	Back to Saturday , Why did you ask if I knew how old you were ? 
Ish:
	I answered that already, again I wanted to know if you thought I looked my age , that's all
	Just checking your " Cougar" radar/tendencies
Sherma:
	You're probably too young for me 
Ish:
	Can't handle younger men I understand
Sherma:
	They can't handle me, got it ?
Ish:
	Even though I'm younger I'm sure I'm more experienced no question
	That's why you didn't want to kiss IMO would've embarrassed yourself is my guess!
	It's ok I'm patient I'll teach you a few things
	If your a good listener and hard worker I'll consider tutoring you
Sherma:
	Blah blah blah , that's all I'm hearing 
Ish:
	This way down the road the next old man you hook up will be a lucky man! That's proof I'm a moral and ethical man
	You ever gonna answer my question about "contain myself" or was that just blah blah blah smh
Sherma:
	Why explain, you're a younger man whom is willing to school me 
	My guess is you already know 
Ish:
	It will be the best class you've ever taken that is a guarantee 
Sherma:
	Psssh, could you just ask your ego to step tot he side 
Ish:
	Sure my lady just trying to be honest !  
	It's not ego when you back it up!  You said to never lie to you my lady 
	So are you admitting that you " can't handle the truth?
Sherma:
	I'm sure in your head you're all of that 
Ish:
	Time will tell I suppose 
	And with your "slowly" comment I'm sure it will be a lot of time , a whole lotta time Mrs discipline my lady of chastity !!! Wtf smh üò±üò±üò±üò±üò±
	üôàüôàüôà
Sherma:
	I won't expect a boy to handle a man's job 
Ish:
	I thought you don't judge my lady!
Sherma:
	No judgement, just facts 
	I'd mey lord choose to be with another, you have your lady consent 
Ish:
	We're that come from! Thanks for your permission... Is it ok if when I go to the bathroom that I leave the toilet seat up too?
	Men do what they want, thanks !  Save that for your lil boys!
	When your ready my lady   I'm sure it will be perfect time no rush no pressure no expectations correct?
	I'm younger so I have more time I can wait just looking out for your best interest my lady , it's the moral thing to do!
Sherma:
	Men do what they want (true) but always need acceptance/approval from their women. 
	Brb 
Ish:
	Ok! 
	Are you interested in being "my woman"?
Sherma:
	Hell No, why would I torture myself 
	Getting dress for work 
Ish:
	Seriously? Not gonna see me anymore?
	?
Sherma:
	We twins, what you think ? 
	Trying to get to the bus now 
	Talk later 
Ish:
	Ok! My lady!
	What are your normal work hours?
Sherma:
	3.30.11.30
Ish:
	So if we are twins like you say there is potential for us?
Sherma:
	The one thing I've learnt is, never say never 
	Talk later okay , just met up w co workers 
Ish:
	ok have fun at work,  never doesn‚Äôt sound too provision though
	provision = promising
	I was hoping for more of a "vote of confidence" then "never say never" üñï
Sherma:
	I would like to keep seeing you
	Not sure where it's going to lead 
Ish:
	Ok thanks ! Must've hurt to admit I'm sure.
	There are no guarantees that's what makes life so special
	Frustrating but special
Sherma:
	Been hurt not sure I wanna go there again 
	Yes I do know that you're not a therapist 
Ish:
	Awwww!! Think your the only one? You've already stated your gonna break my heart!
	Also stated I'd make you happy it didn't work out if I remember correctly 
Sherma:
	I do remember 
Ish:
	Think there is any credibility in my statements?
Sherma:
	I don't know you well enough to say whether it's credible or not. I know people say what you want to hear 
Ish:
	Have I been wrong yet?üòé
	Since you admitted (reluctantly) you'd like to keep seeing me any idea when? I'll check my busy schedule and do my best to accommodate you my lady!
	When would you like to reserve me? Make a reservation ( in your language)
Sherma:
	Why would you want to continue seeing me ?
	Just a question 
Ish:
	So many reasons 
Sherma:
	No bs/no lies
Ish:
	You are pulchritudinous and have a good heart!
	And if it should happen  I think the sex would be amazing 
Sherma:
	You think I'm breathtaking ??? 
Ish:
	Yup
Sherma:
	You should have worn your other glasses 
Ish:
	All the bull makes breathing a bit difficult üòò
	Lol you looked up pulchritudinous pretty fast!
Sherma:
	Got dictionary app on my phone. I try learning a new word every day. This is definitely a good one 
	Thz 
Ish:
	YW
	Did I give good answers ?
Sherma:
	What I got is that you wanna have sex with me
Ish:
	Always look at the cup half empty üò©
Sherma:
	Nope I'm real 
	Don't sugar coat bs
Ish:
	You didn't like my answers ? Tried to be honest playful moral and ethical and funny
	I'd wouldn't of brought up sex if I was trying to tell you what you wanted to hear I'm not stupid
	I should get some credit for that my lady
	I guess I can never win omg back to the fam zone I guess !!üò©üò©üò©
Sherma:
	You're very good with words
	Hold on for a few. In the middle of something 
	Super busy right now, sorry 
	Will pick it up when I can 
Ish:
	ok np don‚Äôt worry 
	DANCE like there's nobody watching, LOVE like you'll never get hurt, SING like there's nobody listening, LIVE like it's heaven on earth!
	Just me being your  therapist for the moment !
	Ta ta ta!
Sherma:
	I love it 
Ish:
	Am I a good therapist?
Sherma:
	You are 
Ish:
	Thanks! Needed to put on the therapist hat so you stop worrying about getting hurt!
	Slowly is one thing non-existent I can't have .... Not happening had to put my foot down on that !!
Sherma:
	Stop trying to get in my head 
Ish:
	It appears your always in your head my lady 
Sherma:
	Not fair 
Ish:
	Sorry I'm gonna have to apparently not happy about it but it what the job calls for
	It = it's
	Stubborn woman of great discipline are all about being in head only way they can achieve their goals
	Defies logic 
Sherma:
	Like what is it you want ?
	What's your true motive ?
Ish:
	More on the menu "the just food" for the second date
	The = then
	To make you happier of course
	Why am I not doing that?
Sherma:
	You are which scares me 
Ish:
	üêìüêìüêì
	Sooo your scared to be happier?
Sherma:
	What follows 
Ish:
	Whatever you want my lady
	What you want to follow?
	What follows lol that's funny you sound like a teenager 
	A teenage virgin üôàüôà on noooooooo!!!
	On = oh
Sherma:
	I meant that hurt always follows happiness 
Ish:
	Gotcha u were being philosophical sorry I was being egotistical my bad
	So sorry!
	I don't believe that but who am I to say
	You must hurt a lot actually always  then since your always happy
	You hurt always since your always happy then no reason to be scared I suppose
	Again,
That's your philosophy not mine
Sherma:
	I don't you to analyze me sit 
	Will talk again in a few 
Ish:
	K
Sherma:
	Redo : I don't like the fact that you're analyzing me 
Ish:
	I'll stop np
	Honestly I'd rather analyze your beautiful tattoos but figured I'd need to analyze your mind first 
	So when can I analyze your tattoos?
Sherma:
	How bout never 
Ish:
	If that's what you want my lady gets
	Your loss 
	Don't want you to get hurt üëä
	üí™
Sherma:
	Don't be mean
Ish:
	You started !!
	You say never say never then all you say today is never wtf
	Cmon!!
Sherma:
	You are a very difficult person to read, and I can't figure you out as of yet. Yet I will admit that I love that logical  way you think 
Ish:
	You said you didn't want predictable..... Told you early on I wasn't predictable 
Sherma:
	Even loving your mind I know that everyone has an agenda 
Ish:
	That's the third time today you mentioned love ( please don't stop) in regards to me and my texts. So before you put on the brakes and downplay it I'm not trying to pay myself on the back . Can you atleast admit I've earned a 2nd date with more than "just food" on the menu and > 0 expectations my lady?
	Pay = pat
	I realize I haven't accomplished much and it's still a "slowly" theme and I have much more work ahead to climb mount Sherma !!
	Which appears 5 times bigger then Mount Everest ! If I'm to be honest
	
Sherma:
	Will a 2 date shut you up?
	My lord 
	Your grace 
Ish:
	Only if you really want a 2nd date with me and are on the same page! Don't wanna twist your arm again like the 1st time my lady
Sherma:
	As I recall I ask you out 
	Get your facts straight 
Ish:
	Sorry my apologies ... But once I swipe right in my mind that's asking you out !
	It's all a formality afterward besides you wrote such an eloquent profile couldn't resist
Sherma:
	Haha 
Ish:
	Do you want me to shut up? I will if that's your desire my lady
Sherma:
	No wanna hear what else you have to say 
	Why did you swipe right ?
	Did I bring you back to familiar territory ?
Ish:
	you  want me to keep talking can't wait for me to screw up and punish me? 
Sherma:
	No punishment here, just honestly on a roll 
Ish:
	Your complexion had nothing to do with it!  
	You love avoiding my questions don't you 
Sherma:
	Was I ?? Didn't realize that, my bad 
Ish:
	Puh-lease! Yeah right
	Again, have I earned a 2nd date my lady?
Sherma:
	Yea my lord, you have 
Ish:
	What will be on the menu for the 2nd date?
Sherma:
	Hold on 
Ish:
	File Transfer: IMG_4466.jpeg
Sherma:
	What would you like on the menu ? What does your heart desire ?
	What's the pic about ?
Ish:
	A bullfighter getting an applause after slaying the bull.... Felt like him after getting confirmation from you on earning a 2nd date !
	Are you saying you give me whatever my heart desires on our 2nd date? Or you just setting me up?
	What you would call fishing! 
	üê¨
	üê†üêü
Sherma:
	1/3 of what your heart desire 
	What is it you want ?
Ish:
	Idk 
	Just don't like limits 
Sherma:
	You can't stop talking and you don't know . Puh- lease 
Ish:
	I held back for your sake on our 1st date rightfully so! It was a great time.
	I honestly don't know. Don't want to come come on too slow or too strong - just right! Haven't determined that yet! That's why I'm asking silly!

	You got it all figure out anyway
Sherma:

Sherma:

	Anything else needs to be address ?
Ish:
	See where it goes‚Ä¶ eh‚Ä¶. Any chance it goes to me seeing your tattoos?

Sherma:
	Stop coating me, sir 
Ish:
	Want me to sleep with another woman before our 4th date?
	You always say is that all you got? I told you that you ain‚Äôt seen nothing yet and my goal is to improve every day.

	So we are still twins?
Sherma:

May I bid you a good night, got a couple things to do before I leave 
Ish:
	Ok one last thing please?
	my lady, ok?
	Since we are twins and probably your only twin‚Ä¶. What are the chances of me seeing your twins? 
Sherma:
	They are two yrs apart üòÄ not twins 
	And yea I know you're not talking about my children 
Ish:
	Very good, my lady!  It took a while to set that one up‚Ä¶.. but it worked out pretty good the timing ,eh?  You said you didn‚Äôt want predictable I hope I wasn‚Äôt my lady!!

Sherma:

Sherma:
	Nite 
	Byee
	Good morning my lord 
	I feel a bit shitty this morning 
	Got nasal congestion, runny nose and a bit of a sore throat 
	Not trying to cut out but runny nose is not what I want when we hang out 
Ish:
	I understand we will play it by ear 
	I want you at 100% anyway.  Besides if you should cancel no problem I'll sure you'll give me credit for a 2nd date anyway and we will just move the menu to a 3rd date! Thanks for being so fair my lady!
Sherma:
	You get what you've earn . There's no jumping ahead my lord wait for the 2nd date, it's gonna happen
Ish:
	Just looking out for your best interest my lady! One day the training wheels must come off!
	If you cancel the line moves it's only fair and we plan for date 3 my lady!
	Line moves forward!
Sherma:
	I can do the 2nd date not bailing, but you would have to take care of me 
Ish:
	A lord always takes care of his lady, duh !
	Of course!
	But if you can't I understand and won't penalize you for it! I'll give you credit and promote you to 3rd date status, in case you were worried about that don't my lady!
Sherma:
	Wow a  promotion. Look at you having my best interest, my lord you do spoil me 
Ish:
	Of course! No games no bs with me! Don't worry I'll take care of you alright!
Sherma:
	How did I ever get so lucky?? Must have done something right 
Ish:
	Apparently the gods are looking down on you my lady!
	And I promise you will be screaming their name very loudly while I take care of you my ladyüòò
Sherma:
	Oh my god. NO, NO 
Ish:
	Yes! Yes! Be positive no negativity 
Sherma:
	Question.. Do men think about sex only ?
Ish:
	I can't speak for men. I don't "only" think about anything! It's appropriate speech for you IMHO! Just trying to push your buttons Ms. 0 expectations ! I hope it is and makes you smile
Sherma:
	I'm not well be nice to me today 
Ish:
	I am being nice I could flip the switch and make you beg for it but I'm not! Please my lady show some gratitude!
Sherma:
	Thank you my gracious lord, I appreciate your kindness 
Ish:
	Please define what you mean by "take care of you " so we can be on the same page my lady.
Sherma:
	How do you take care of someone that's not doing well üò¢
Ish:
	Tlc?
	You're the nurse not me
Sherma:
	That will help some 
	Am not a nurse 
	Am a cna 
	Ed tech 
	Cna= cma
Ish:
	Ok cna or cma it don't matter as long as I get some tna I'll be happy my lady !

Sherma:

Ish:
	Np least I can do! Hope you feel better! Any chance your going through "Artie withdrawal s" ! Rumor has that's it's a very tough addiction to get over!
Sherma:
	Yea that's what it is withdrawal, never had it so good that my body craves it 
Ish:
	Thanks I really like the fact we are finally being honest with eachother! It's a real turn on my lady!

Sherma:

	It's only been a few hrs 
Ish:
	Feeling better? Or still under the weather 
Sherma:
	Nah I feel like crap 
Ish:
	Awwww! Now I'm glad we didn't kiss or you'd be blaming me for it! See every cloud does have a silver lining 
Sherma:
	I probably would have 
	That would have lead to no 3rd date 
Ish:
	You mean no 2nd or we now on our 3rd my lady
Sherma:
	You were already credited for the 2nd date 
Ish:
	And you're a woman of your word ! I get it
	Sooo even before our 2nd date you would deny me a 3rd wow!!! What's that about!
Sherma:
	Am delusional sir, forgive me 
	The fever is getting the better of me 
Ish:

Sherma:

	Feeling clean my lady?
Sherma:
	Bubble bath does magic 
Ish:
	Needed to clean off all my dirty innuendo ?
	Speechless?
Sherma:
	Doesn't have enough water to wash that off my lord 
Ish:
	Lol!
	Sorry my lady I like (as your learning ) to push the limits or barriers put in front of me
	To build up things to a climax but since our next meeting has been pushed back (uggh) I promise to reverse my approach and back off my lady ! 
	You've been given a reprieve 
	Back to the friend zone 
	üë´
Sherma:
	Your lady acknowledges and accepts the token of friendship 
Ish:
	Don't wanna be predictable and boring I can wear many hats! 
	Besides I hope your sickness isn't psychosomatic 
	Sooo since your my lady does that mean your not chatting with any of your other 35+ matches?
Sherma:
	Does my lord have an issue being challenged? 
Ish:
	You challenge me all the time and I have no issue with you!
	The biggest challenge appears to get you to answer my questions smh
	Taking the 5th Mrs honesty?
	How long have you been single for?
	Ever date a white guy before?
Sherma:
	Been single for 2 yrs
Ish:
	2 years sweet! Are you over him or her?
Sherma:
	I've had 2 relationships, one 6 months, that I'm best friends with
Ish:
	Plz feel free to answer the other friendly questions as well
Sherma:
	I will do almost anything for him. He's been there for me and I wouldn't turn my back on him for anyone 
	He's a nurse that I work with for a couple yrs
Ish:
	Don‚Äôt understand ‚ÄúI've had 2 relationships, one 6 months, that I'm best friends with‚Äù Are you referring to only 2 relationships in your life my lady? 1. Your husband and 2. this nurse guy you dated for 6 months?? 
Sherma:
	The other relationship lasted 3 months. A doctor that I was in love with, he moved to Cali and wanted me to move with him. I hD a choice to make and I choose my children
	Three in total 
Ish:
	Any of them white?
Sherma:
	Both 
	Irish  and the other is Irish and German 
Ish:
	The Dr. is the one that hurt you I suppose, you were referring to that the other day about being scared of getting hurt.  So my lady after meeting me are you starting to believe that 4 is your lucky number?
Sherma:
	My husband is the who hurt me he deepest 
	Don't think I can ever love like that again 
Ish:
	but none of these 3 you considered your twin correct?
Sherma:
	I was a woman that was madly in love with her husband, my world revolved around him 
Ish:
	Was your husband your twin? And according to you twin = chemistry related!
	Sorry to hear how you got hurt and it didn‚Äôt work out with him. Thanks for sharing.
	I guess he couldn‚Äôt handle you!
Sherma:
	I don't think I'm capable of loving someone so deeply that I become vulnerable 
	And open itself to be hurt again, so my walls go up 
Ish:
	I‚Äôm a jerk and an arrogant selfish egotistical womanizer so please don‚Äôt care about me. Leave those walls down my lady!
	Way down!
	Did your walls go up during  your other 2 relationships?
Sherma:
	Yes, it made it easier for me to let them go 
Ish:
	Appreciate your honesty. Means  a lot!!
Sherma:
	A lot of the things you said was true about me 
Ish:
	Just lucky guesses my lady I know nothing just like Jon Snow
	Do you wanna know why I am the way I am with words?
Sherma:
	Enlighten me 
Ish:
	Will you guarantee me a 3rd kiss on our next date if I do?
Sherma:
	A kiss 
Ish:
	A kiss? wtf
	Your a woman of your word you already said you‚Äôd give me 2? Or you reneging on that already?
Sherma:
	Damn 
	Okay 2 is it 
	Start talking 
Ish:
	3?
Sherma:
	Nah 2
Ish:
	3 and I talk my lady
	I already got two what motivating do I have to reveal one of my secrets ?
	Correction - I already got two kisses whats motivating me to  reveal one of my secrets ?
	Main secrets twin
Sherma:
	Because you like me :)
	Reason enough 
Ish:
	I did like you until you blew me off and stopped answering my questions 
	And besides you have 35+ matches 
	And since you won‚Äôt comment about the exclusivity of our twinship I‚Äôm starting to believe your the one cutting and  pasting and not me my shady lady
	4?
	4  kisses?
	Be lucky I‚Äôm not asking for 35, one for each of your matches my lady!!
Sherma:
	Are you saying you don't like me anymore ?
Ish:
	Depends on your answer my lady? You want out of the friends zone I hope
Sherma:
	The agreement was 2 kisses and no time frame 
Ish:
	I agree with the agreement that‚Äôs fine.
	I wanted to add a sweetener and reveal a valuable secret for an extra kiss 
	Remember - ‚Äúfirst you do then you get‚Äù
	But you hesitated on the 3rd kiss so now it‚Äôs up to 4?
	Take it or leave it my lady?
	4 or 35? you pick
Sherma:
	2, and you have yourself a deal 
Ish:
	That is already the deal
	I‚Äôm trying to renegotiate with my lady
Sherma:
	Stop procrastinating 
Ish:
	Learned it from you
	Your Mrs. P not me
Sherma:
	Yea yea. With 0 expectations 
	Continue my lord 
Ish:
	That 0 expectations nonsense is done with my lady
	We either on 4 or 35? You pick my lady if you wanna hear what I have to reveal
	Otherwise you can just keep hearing my eloquent speech and not know the source.  I‚Äôm fine with that.
	No pain no gain my lady!!
	You wanna run from pain you will never gain my happy lady!!
	üêì
	üêìüêìüêì  sorry 3 chicks for your 3 lil boys!!
Sherma:
	I'm not running, I've walked away and its  a familiar territory, I will be okay 
Ish:
	A wise person once told me if you meet someone you like don‚Äôt only kick in the front wall but also the back wall
Sherma:
	Are you not talking anymore :(
Ish:
	Motivate me‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm all ears if you wanna share anything‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ won‚Äôt hold it against you.  
	Just being playful about the 3 chicks hopefully your stomach hurts a bit from it
	But until you up the ante to 3 kisses I‚Äôm not gonna reveal one of my secrets.
	They are called secrets for a reason my lady
Sherma:
	Not sure it's gonna be  worth it. I could easily cut my losses and walk away.   
Ish:
	Probably should, seem to be you MO
	Do what you do best my lady! I want you at your best! If your better at walking and hiding then kissing probably best for both of us!!
	Just giving your friendly advice from the friend zone!üë´
Sherma:
	Thanks friend 
Ish:
	What are friends for!
Sherma:
	Touch√© 
Ish:
	You walking away? Or running forward lol!
Sherma:
	I'm here, aren't I ?
Ish:
	idk was getting worried
	Just kidding I have faith in you!
	I do mean that.  Faith is an amazing thing you should try it sometime.
Sherma:
	Call me, my eyes are beginning to hurt from the screen again 
	We could talk for a bit 
Ish:
	K

Sherma:
	I sound like a man w my voice, just saying 
Ish:
	 
 1 min
	Np with your twins strapped in on our 1st date you resembled one a bit
Sherma:
	Haha 
Ish:
	Is it so hard for my lady to give her lord what he wants?
	Does my lady not trust her lord?
Sherma:
	Your lady trust no man except her daddy and he's no longer here :(
Ish:
	That's a very pessimistic answer
	But me being an optimist love that answer you wanna know why?
Sherma:
	If it's gonna cost me anything else, then hell no
Ish:
	Lol! No cost 
	Good answer!! Way to use that mind finally
Sherma:
	There's no point in me having one if you're  gonna be doing the thinking for me 
Ish:
	In love that answer because it tells me since you've slept with 3 guys already and trust 0 ---- it means I don't have to earn your trust to get what they got! And I'll get even more if I can!
	In = I 
	Is my optimistic mind correct ?
Sherma:
	You're optimistic mind is fucked up 
Ish:
	Is it true? It's your statement I'm reacting too
Sherma:
	You might come close too 
	Getting what they got 
Ish:
	close only matters in horseshoes and hand grenades. I want and deserve more!!
	Can you handle my request?
Sherma:
	We all deserve allot of things but we all don't get what we want 
Ish:
	I only want what I deserve? Do you promise to be fair with me my lady?
Sherma:
	What have you done this far that makes you  deserving of anything ?
	Gimme a few 
	Brb
Ish:
	Your the judge, I don‚Äôt or shouldn‚Äôt have to remind you! Im not asking for anything yet, just asking my lady when the time comes to be fair and just!!
Sherma:
	I promise to be fair 
Ish:
	That's all I can ask! So my lady will put her faith in me until proven otherwise?
Sherma:
	Your lady is a pessimist, she put faith only on herself 
	Can you stay around long enough to convince her otherwise 
Ish:
	Will I get what I want if I stay around and convince her?
Sherma:
	Odds in your favor 
	Did my Lord not have enough of me today 
Ish:
	Are you saying you can't handle your lords appetite?
Sherma:
	I spent almost the entire day with you my lord 
Ish:
	Shit! You got off easy we should've been lip locking now if you didn't tap out earlier
	Compromise with me- give me credit for a 2nd date with all the talk and all and I'll leave you alone and we'll agree to got to 3rd date menu. Ok? Thanks my lady you are da best!!!!!
	Work with your man my lady! 
Sherma:
	Work with me ?? 
Ish:
	Work = compromise 
	Ok? On to 3rd date next week! I think today our 2nd date was even better then our 1st since you like me more and I now like you more!
	Perfect! Thanks for giving me what I want!
	I recommend to practice your kissing technique this weekend a lot rides on it!
	No pressure my lady!
	Deal?
Sherma:
	Not gonna be a problem, got a date 
Ish:
	So it's a deal? We on to date 3?
Sherma:
	What we had today was conversation, not a date 
	And stop jumping ahead , do you have add?
Ish:
	A phone date it was! Conversation is the most important thing about a date
	It was very good conversation ! Thanks you don't wanna give me credit fine! No hard feelings just gauging your sense of fairness ! A two hour phone call I believe could and maybe should qualify as a date! The jury is still out on your fairness my lady! I'll still keep having faith in you but your on a short leash Sherma!!
	Short lease Sherma has a ring to it ! I like it!
Sherma:
	Puh- lease, like you gonna walk walk from me 
Ish:
	Lol!!
	You know me well!
	So am I starting to gap your trust after 2 dates now short lease Sherma?
	Gap =gain 
Sherma:
	Walk= away
Ish:
	I know I understood
	Actually didn't see the 2nd walk --- took it as 'walk from me' optical illusion I guess
	Funny either and probably correct my lady
	Either way
	So am I starting to gap your trust after 2 dates now short lease Sherma?
	Gap =gain 
Sherma:
	You assume too much
Ish:
	Correct good catch, trying to trick you and be playful!  thanks for being a good sport. I mean that my lady!
	And for that  I can‚Äôt wait to consummate our 2nd date with a kiss and close that friend zone forever!!
Sherma:
	Eloquently said 
Ish:
	You ain‚Äôt seen or felt nothing yet my lady!!
	Better get all those feelings for your other guys and remember them deeply, cuz they will all be erased when I get my hands (and lips) on you my lady! Abracadabra - Disappear!!
	And the greatest things is I‚Äôll only need 1 kiss but I got 2!!!!!! You and your other guys are screwed!!!
	I recommend while you practicing your kissing this weekend you might wanna throw them a going away party while your at it!
Sherma:
	So full of yourself , there's a fine line bet confidence and cockiness 
Ish:
	You stole that from me!  When you look up confidence in dictionary you‚Äôll see my picture
Sherma:
	I hate the fact that you remember everything 
Ish:
	 It's a blessing and a curse
	Just like you short lease Sherma 
	File Transfer: IMG_3472.jpeg
	Like my dimples my lady?
Sherma:
	
I can show you mine also
	But it will definitely be inappropriate,and your lady is still a lady 
Ish:
	Please do! I like looking at you
	Any and every pic is appreciated considering I'm not gonna see you for a while
Sherma:
	Not that kind of pic my lord, it's my finger 
Ish:
	When two people are being real and honest with eachother very lil is inappropriate 
	Was my pic inappropriate ?
Sherma:
	Thought you were being sarcastic with your middle finger, you do have a dry sense of humor 
Ish:
	Sorry if it bothered you! Have you been watching game of thrones lately my lady?
Sherma:
	No, not lately 
	Started but need to watch it w/o interruption 
Ish:
	I'm sorry and I understand Would it be off limits to watch it with you one day?
Sherma:
	You could watch it from your place and so it from mine, we'll stay on the phone :)
	Does that work for you ?
Ish:
	Would it be considered a date? Would I get credit?
Sherma:
	NO CREDIT!!!
Ish:
	Then it wouldn't be acceptable !
	Ducking my question again smh! Off limits? Yes or no?
	Watching together! Same place 
Sherma:
	When the new season begins, I'll consider it 
Ish:
	New season - season 6?
Sherma:
	I do not bring anyone into my home, that's the way it is
Ish:
	i understand! 
	GN! I‚Äôll leave you alone! Try watching game of thrones finish season 3 its has a very memorable ending!
Sherma:
	Kk 
	Good nite my lord 
	Can't talk but this song reminds of ur, check it out 
	
Sebastian Ingrosso Ft. Tommy Trash & John Martin - Reload (Official Music Video)
Ish:
	Thanks I like the song pretty sweet! üòçI'll take this as a compliment and subtract a kiss from your required duties if you wish my lady! Hope your feeling better!
	Not to be a ball buster but I'd have preferred you sent me this video 

	https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=_QC00oZ1q10
	But no one is perfect ! Thx again my lady for the kind gesture and putting a smile on my face ! Now please practice your kissing and finish season 3 of games of thrones! Thx
	As of late I‚Äôve found physical attraction is no longer enough. I need genuine connection. I need to undress the layers of a soul before I feel a desire to tear away any clothes. Passion remains the fire, but now intimacy strikes the match, and friendship has become the fuel.
	Enjoy!
	Everything ok? Kidnapped? Sleeping?
Sherma:
	Hey good morning, phone fell into water, left it in rice to dry out. 
	I'm great thanks, caught up on game of thrones üëç
	You were right, season 3 was crazy, anyways have a great day and ttyl, Byee 
Ish:
	Good to have you back! 
	Are you ggg?
Sherma:
	What??
Ish:
	I guess the answer is no then lol!. No big deal! Glad you finished season 3 did you do the other part of your homework this weekend?
Sherma:
	Sure did
Ish:
	On who your nursing buddy? Np I'm proud of you!  Thanks!! Also, did you like the song/video I sent you?
Sherma:
	Mad cute 
	I like 
Ish:
	Thx I try! 
	Thanks to you as well for the video as well
Sherma:
	Wyd?
Ish:
	Babysitting my nephew atm being a good godfather! 
	Wyd? 
	Phone alive?
Sherma:
	Not by much 
	I'm at 25%
Ish:
	Still at work? Figured you might be off at 3:39
	3:30
Sherma:
	I don't ever leave on time sir 
Ish:
	Such a good worker! Goes the extra mile .... A wonderful quality!
	Feeling better from your cold? Battery is at 25% what % is my lady at?
Sherma:
	I don't leave till the job is completed to my satisfaction 
	Am at 75%
Ish:
	When you gonna be strong enough to go out with me again?
	Fwiw, if you weren't on tinder all day maybe your phone wouldn't die so quick 
Sherma:
	It scares me how well you know me 
Ish:
	Any idea,  When you gonna be strong enough to go out with me again?
Sherma:
	Probably by the end of the week 
	Or next week 
Ish:
	Really?
Sherma:
	Were you hoping for never ?
Ish:
	Another week? How am I gonna survive
	Being in your presence gives me the strength to carry on
	I need my twin(s)
Sherma:
	You are full of it  :)) Look at episodes of game of thrones and you'ld be fine 
Ish:
	Or they fake too like your interest in me
	No more games of thrones for me until April my lady! Let's reenact the show since we are twins I'll be Jaime Lannister and you'll be cersei Lannister ok?
	Deal?
Sherma:
	Don't wanna ruin the outcome 
	So let's just wait for April 
Ish:
	Cmon!! Why the cold shoulder!
	Why aren't you taking me serious ! One date every 2 weeks!!! I need more
	This is unacceptable 
	üò°
Sherma:
	Be thankful for your freedom my lord 
Ish:
	Please by all means tie me up and don't leave until the job is done to your satisfaction my lady
	Be consistent !
	Finish the job! Sorry there's more work to be done here
	My lady needs to do her job! Quit slacking please
	üò§
Sherma:
	We still talking bout kisses. Correct ?
Ish:
	Nope talking about seeing eachother 
	Get ur head out of gutter 
	You read my passage about physical attraction not being enough over weekend
	No kisses until I get to know you better
	That's reason we didn't kiss on 1st date I wasn't ready sorry
Sherma:
	That wasn't the reason tho, we had a no kiss on the 1st date rule 
Ish:
	Be patient with me please
Sherma:
	I have nothing but patience my lord 
Ish:
	I'm worth the wait but 2 weeks for 2nd date is a bit too much
Sherma:
	You're worth the wait ?? 
	Thought I was 
Ish:
	I already told you about my biological clock
Sherma:
	Hit the reset button on the clock, my lord 
Ish:
	You can't do better then "end of the week maybe next week"?
Sherma:
	Let my body get back to 95 % at least 
	Don't  wanna be choking up when I'm with you 
	Still have that cough 
Ish:
	Understand! Get better my lady no worries like you already said "I'm not going anywhere" 
Sherma:
	Let's retract, are you saying you wanna see me 
	??
	Like 2 people seeing each other ?
Ish:
	For being so understanding, patient and loyal what are you gonna give me in return (since you said earlier that's all I care about)?
	I wanna see you ! ASAP 
	I like things simple, easy no games - your the one who like challenges and games and playfulness and making things difficult 
	Does your definition of "2 people seeing eachother" involve TLC? Fluids? Physical activities?
Sherma:
	Everything in moderation my lord 
	Until I know you better 
Ish:
	How well do you know yourself my lady?
Sherma:
	I've lived myself for a long time, I would say pretty well. Why?
Ish:
	Cuz if we‚Äôre twins how much better can you know me then!
	You know me all too well.
	I Jaime and your Cersei
	Moderate that my lady!
Sherma:
	

Ish:
	?
Sherma:
	Hold on
	Let me talk in a few 
Ish:
	k
Sherma:
	I don't do incest my lord 
	So we'll have to drop the twin thing 
Ish:
	Ok I understand that's the best news yet ! We can be just spiritual twins!
	But atleast admit being your spiritual twin means you don't need to know me better
	Thanks my lady made me very very happy
	üëç
Sherma:
	working 
Ish:
	Good someone's gotta support us!  
Sherma:
	lol 
	How was ur wknd?
Ish:
	When you gonna be ready for round 2?
	Nice and quiet 
	How was urs?
Sherma:
	Was really nice, stress free 
Ish:
	Are you hinting at that I cause you stress?
Sherma:
	Absolutely not 
Ish:
	Did you miss me and my nonsense?
Sherma:
	Miss ur nonsense 
Ish:
	Likewise üòò
Sherma:
	What ?? I don't come with nonsense 
Ish:
	Neither do I
Sherma:
	That's debatable 
Ish:
	Likewise my lady
Sherma:
	Whatever 
Ish:
	Whatever
	Buying a woman dinner and getting no play can be considered nonsense in some parts and probably a death sentence in some middle eastern countries 
	Yet I still persevere .... Give me some credit pleaseüò©!
Sherma:
	Psssh, food?? Are you serious ?
	I did ask why you are still sticking around 
Ish:
	Soo ungrateful my lady is smh
	Waiting around to see you belly dance why else would a hot commodity like myself stick around?
Sherma:
	Next time I will
Pay for the food :)
Ish:
	Just your promise you'll be there is payment enough my lady
	And ofcourse my 3 smooches!!üòò
Sherma:
	Smh 
Ish:
	I sure hope you're practicing 
Sherma:
	Always want something in return 
Ish:
	Honestly , Just being in your presence is enough 
Sherma:
	My ex think I shouldn't trust you, my lord 
Ish:
	He's probably right 
	Wait! My lady told another living soul about us?
	If true I think that's great news! 
Sherma:
	I told you he's my best friend 
	I tell him everything 
Ish:
	More the merrier! He wanna come on our next date? Will his approval get me the initial 5 sooner?
Sherma:
	Don't think he approves :(
	No chance of him coming 
Ish:
	What about me he don't like or trust?
Sherma:
	Maybe you remind him of himself 
Ish:
	Soo you ex and best friend don't trust himself smh
	Or like himself sounds like a keeper 
	Np I've made it a living   proving people wrong ! 
Sherma:
	It's true that women shouldn't trust him, he manipulate with words 
	And yes I still want him as my friend 
	That's the reason we are not together as a couple 
Ish:
	I don't pick my lady's friends, befriend who you want np no drama here only nonsense (according to you )
Sherma:
	Yea yea yea
	What you wanna do on the next date?
Ish:
	Not this again anything my lady's heart desires 
Sherma:
	Do = go
	Sorry 
Ish:
	Can we 'go' all the way? Or is that the next date?
Sherma:
	Lucid dream ?
	File Transfer: IMG_0469.PNG
Ish:
	Never say never? Besides life without dreams could be a bit dull ,eh ?
Sherma:
	Can be ,Phone is about to die 
	Ttyl my lord 
Ish:
	üíî
Sherma:
	In the real world things aren't always what they appear. So forgive me my lord, I would like to get to know you 
	I would like to leave the spirituality for the heavenly regions 
Ish:

Ish:

	Also, what did you think of my "cold mind" comment?
Sherma:
	Non applicable, my heart is cold 
	As for Wednesday, food ??
Ish:
	Stop it! You have a very good and warm heart!
	Any restrictions like "just food" for Wednesday ? Wanna be on the same page with my lady's cold mind !
	I wouldn't be interested if I thought you had a cold heart!

Sherma:

Ish:

Sherma:
	Why?
Ish:
	Wanna know your expectations for me?
	I'm a temporary hold smh
	Hand holding buddy?
	What you need to know about me? And....... Why don't you trust me? 
Sherma:
	The real you, not the guy hiding behind his words 
Ish:
	Not true and you know that
	All we've been doing is talking texting ... You cancelled on me what more can I do?
	Words is all we been doing 
	I don't make you happy?
	All I'm trying to do is make you happier so in turn you'll make me happier
Sherma:
	I look forward to talking to you and when I don't, I miss it 
Ish:
	You mean it?
Sherma:
	Yea
	Yes
Ish:
	Does that bother you? Am I upsetting your nice neat apple cart?
Sherma:
	It makes me uneasy to say the least 
Ish:
	Should I back off a bit tell you a few lies or something ?
Sherma:
	I wasn't looking to get into anything with anyone. Got out of a long term and didn't want to jump in so soon 
Ish:
	Are you dumping me? üòÇüòÇ
	Join tinder just for a hookup?
Sherma:
	No hook ups , just conversation. You may not believe me but it's true 
Ish:
	Trust me I believe you!
Sherma:
	And their you were, giving me a hard time and I enjoyed it 
Ish:
	Is that good or bad?
Sherma:
	It was all good 
Ish:
	I make you happier?
Sherma:
	You do 
Ish:
	How does happier = "uneasy to say the least "
	üò¥üò¥üí§
Sherma:
	Uneasy because I fear the outcome 
	Gotta be up at 4.30 not running 
	Can I say good night my lord 
Ish:
	Sure...... What outcome you fear my lady?
	Don't leave me on edge plz
Sherma:
	I fear falling in love and getting hurt 
Ish:
	What a paradox? Don't we all Sherma 
	So far I'm doing good tho ? Correct?
Sherma:
	Yea ur all good 
Ish:
	If I keep playing my cards right could I end up being a lucky man?
Sherma:
	You forgot one very important part of this story 
	You're still married 
Ish:
	That's a formality 
	I'm not looking to get married anytime soon 
	We have time for that part correct?
	Plenty of time before we talk marriage correct?
	I'm only a temporary hold (your words) anyway
	I'm not even allowed anywhere near your place?
	I'm not even allowed to put my hand on your ass
	Those my lady are much more important parts then my "status". 
	To me anyway! Each his/her own! We can talk all about it Wednesday if you like! If your up to it !
	Sorry don't wanna keep u   Up thx for sharing ur feelings 
	Any chance you would consider making me happier before I get down on one knee my lady? 
Sherma:
	First, I don't foresee myself getting married  again. I can do the live with but no marriage 
	2nd. Am a mother first and I have daughters that I swore to protect. Hence the reason I've never invited any man over 
	3rd, I am trying to get out of my head. Probably not fast enough for you but I am 
Ish:
	Be yourself don't change ! In don't understand then after reading #1 why or how I'm forgetting an important part about being married
	How is that an "important part" of the story (love the fact you said story ---- you hated that reference when we first met)
Sherma:
	I dislike it when it comes from you. Hate is such a strong word 
Ish:
	What's up with you and stories ? Memories are built on clusters of happiness. Stories are a bit boring be saw they become predictable. I love spontaneity
	That's what you said....boring better choice I guess .
	Is our story boring? Mrs 0 expectations just food no kissing and only hand holding?
	Sound like spontaneity to you ? Lol puhlease
	I've adding the excitement to the story and unpredictable stuff admit it ?
	Adding = added
Sherma:
	You're annoying to the point where you make a lot of sense 
Ish:
	Your words not mine
Sherma:
	Nobody likes a smart ass . Just saying 
Ish:
	You saying you don't like me now? I'm sorry
Sherma:
	Artie I like you a lot to the point where it's scares me if I continue seeing you and would scare me even more if I don't 
Ish:
	Is that how you normally get with guys you are interested in?
Sherma:
	I push them away the moment I start  felling something 
Ish:
	Bullshit!
	You didn't do that with your best friend or Mr. California
	Why me?
Sherma:
	With Chris I made a choice, either to move with him or end it ( Cali ) I ended it 
Ish:
	Understandable Cuz of your daughters
	Family first remember
Sherma:
	Always and forever 
Ish:
	How the mighty have fallen my lady a week ago or so I looking in the dictionary I see your pretty face under confidence now you picture has been removed and moved to "damaged goods" ! Lol just kidding my lady
Sherma:
	Like me. You live with other people. Which makes it difficult if we wanted to just hang out and watch a movie 
	How do you propose we see each other 
Ish:
	You can come by me anytime I've been thinking about it ill take care of it
Sherma:
	That's gonna be weird 
Ish:
	Not for me
	My grandma is the best
	I'll tell them your my ex sister
	If we progress ofcourse 
	I'm not committing to anything until after our 2nd date if we still have chemistry
	If you ever show up my lady 
	And turn into Mrs confidence not Mrs damaged 
Sherma:
	Shit up . 2 nd date it is, sometime this week 
Ish:
	I'll believe it when I see it! Have you been playing with Angry Orchard?
Sherma:
	Not lately 
Ish:
	Is our 2nd date gonna be good? Be honest!
Sherma:
	If we still have chemistry, I'm sure it will be 
Ish:
	Or you gonna push me away the minute you start feeling something?
	Or when I start feeling you? Or do I need to bring a divorce decree to touch you?
	File Transfer: IMG_1066.JPG
Sherma:
	Stop thinking so far ahead and just look forward to that moment 
Ish:
	That's you not me
Sherma:
	I have to go to bed sir 
Ish:
	You still got 2 kisses reserved for me my lady?
	File Transfer: IMG_1067.JPG
Sherma:
	Shut up my lord 
	I have to go to bed for real 
Ish:
	Yes or no?
Sherma:
	Tomorrow 
Ish:
	What about tommorrow ?
Sherma:
	I'll answer more of your questions tomorrow 
Ish:

Sherma:
	Good nite sir 
Ish:

Sherma:
	Morning, morning 
	At work, so have a great day 
Ish:
	Likewise! Have you been practicing ?
Sherma:
	 That would be a negative 
Ish:
	Why not? Did you not like my pics?
	The ones I took and sent last nite in real time
Sherma:
	Yes my lord, the pic  were great 
	Are you trying to make a point with the real one ? 
Ish:
	Should I shave for our date or keep it scruffy 
Sherma:
	Ehh
	Not too scruffy 
	Don't shave 
Ish:
	Ok don't sound too confident I could just shape it if u want
	Since you didn't practice on them last night figured (that's the real negative IMO)
Sherma:
	Omg , I live the scruffy look, plz don't shave 
	Was that better my lord 
Ish:
	Much better my lady  I'll be sure to shave don't want you breaking any predetermined rules we set
	And since we're being honest you can not
Tell me the real reason your phone needed to be dried out in rice ?
	Not = now
Sherma:
	It did since I'm being honest 
	You have no issues with me seeing anyone and I was over at my ex 
	Am open about everything 
Ish:
	What were you doing with your ex?
Sherma:
	He's renovating his apt , I was helping him out 
Ish:
	Were you practicing with him?
Sherma:
	We're not like that anymore 
	I love him but not in love with him, huge difference 
	And I'm no skank 
Ish:
	Understand so you were practicing with my tinder pics and the pics I texted you and that's how the phone got soaked! Good answers and thx for practicing 
	I won't hold it against you! You've been pardoned my lady
	I don't believe your a skank my lady! Just want you to be my skank, ok?
Sherma:
	Just so you know, I don't sleep around 
Ish:
	I trust you!
Sherma:
	You don't have too, I trust me enough 
Ish:
	Again for the record ,I don't believe your a skank my lady! Just want you to be my skank, ok? 
	Didn't like my question /statement my lady?
Sherma:
	Not hurt by it 
Ish:
	Not happy either apparently?
Sherma:
	I'm good

Ish:
	Your mind might‚Äôve said no but your body was saying yes

Ish:

	Right before you left
	No?
Sherma:
	That would have been the moment 
Ish:
	Your body was saying yes ! You were burning up IMO that's when you started getting sick 
	You rejected your body's desires and it broke during week that's why u had to cancel on Thursday 
	Had to teach my lady a valuable lesson 
	Your not mad I rejected your advances last time are you?
Sherma:
	No, was just a test to see if you were easy

Ish:

	Sorry I didn‚Äôt plan the last two weeks but a very wise woman who I respect a great deal once said ‚ÄúDon't know what the future holds but I've learnt that the best made plans are laid to rest‚Äù
Sherma:
	Damn
	Was asking about planning a date not a lifetime 
Ish:
	Following your lead my lady

Sherma:
	I was drinking , what do I know ?
Ish:

Sherma:

	Damn, why the heck did I bring up my valentines day plan. Damn I have a big fucken mouth
	I always shoot myself in the foot! Shit!!!!!!!!
Sherma:

Sherma:

	3
Ish:
	I like you! So we can go out this weekend sometime?

	Do you always kiss so passionately or did I bring it out of you?
	First couple you seemed a bit nervous and scared
Sherma:
	I am very passionate. 1st time kissing, looking for chemistry. Anything after depends on what I feel or not feel 
Ish:
	Whats on menu for sunday? I planned last one you can (if you want) plan this on, ok?
	on = one
Sherma:
	Wanted to see 
Concussion w Will Smith, r u up 4 it ?
Ish:

	Afternoon showing sound good?
	Ever look into 13 hours movie?
	Hateful 8?
	Just some suggestions you might not have considered
	I want the best for my lady!
Sherma:
	Is there such a thing as 13 movie, who wants to sit that long ?
Ish:
	Name of the movie is 13 hours? lol
	Michael Bay directed
Sherma:
	Haven't watched tv in over two months 
	My bad, haven't heard of it 
Ish:
	Michael Bay did it - he did big budget movies like transformers and pear harbor
	Its about the benghazi terrorist attack on the us embassy
Sherma:
	Sounds good 
Ish:
	Hateful 8 is quentin tarantino - He did pulp fiction, django unchained kill bill movies
	Just to set the record straight my lady we are getting close, do you agree?
	ü§î
Sherma:
	It's a movie my lord 
	Not a proposal 
Ish:
	Whatever not what I meant you just love to downplay meüò©!

	Read it and weep my lady!
	According to this my lady IMHO you will be proposing by valentines day!!!üòçüíî
Sherma:
	I don't go off on polls, I do what's best for me 
Ish:
	No "we" still just "me" ? üò§üò§üò§üò§
	File Transfer: IMG_1079.JPG
	Since you appear to have it all figured out Mrs. "Selfish" , what's best for you? (You said earlier to fire away just honoring my lady's wishesüòé)
Sherma:
	With questions my
Lord 
Ish:
	I just asked 2 questions
	No "we" still just "me" ? üò§üò§üò§üò§ --- is question 1
Sherma:
	That's what I meant when I said fire away 
Ish:
	And 2nd question is ----- what's best for you?
	I know what you meant! Just being playful please don't get upset!
	Just like pressuring you when I'm away that's all! Just like you I never give up !!!!
	Am I too much for you to handle? My lady want me to ease up?
Sherma:
	Takes a lot to get me upset, I'm not a child . 
Ish:
	You wanna go back to training wheels?
	"Just movie" for Sunday?
Sherma:
	Once training wheels off it can't go back in 
	It's off 
Ish:
	That's my lady!! 
	She's made an appearance whoo hooo!!!!
Sherma:
	And I will still maintain"me" and you do "you"
	You're not liking this, I'm sure 
Ish:
	Ok Mrs " got it all figured out" 
	Why can't it be us? This is not a proposal! Rather row in same direction is all I'm saying 
	I thought "us" did pretty good Wednesday 
	You disagree?
Sherma:
	We did good 
	You were good and I amazing , lol
	Together we did good :)
Ish:
	Agreed! I held back you didn't! Didn't want you to overheat took it easy on you! Lol
	In due time my lady! No rush!
Sherma:
	That my lord was child's play 
	Just saying 
Ish:
	I'll believe when I see it
	You were the one hyperventilating not me
	I'm bringing my pepper spray Sunday 
Sherma:
	You're not that irresistible my lord :)
	But I'll need my taser 
Ish:
	Always putting me down smh
Sherma:
	Thought you like going down, smh 
Ish:
	My lady full of surprises, good one there! Wouldn't you like to know 
	Is the song I sent you a week ago more applicable today?
Sherma:
	Not just yet, but I'm sure in time I would 
Ish:
	Are you giving me a compliment? 
	Saying what exactly?
Sherma:
	Compliments extended to you 
Ish:
	Thx
Sherma:
	Wyd? Seem distracted 
Ish:
	Showing up on our dates however is the biggest compliment my lady can give 
	Always distracted my lady however you I make top priority 
Sherma:
	Why, becomes the question of the day 
Ish:
	Why what exactly?
Sherma:
	Why I'm I top priority ?
Ish:
	Cuz we haven't had our bedding ceremony yet! 
	What else is there ? Lol
	Maybe it because I'm hung up on my ex and you remind me of her so I replace her with you!!! Lol
	And since I can't have her I go for you cause I'm damaged and not over her
	I Still seem distracted now my lady?
	Honestly !!! I like you a lot and don't care why! Just happier that's all! And can't wait to see you Sunday cuz it will be even better then Thursday! 
	So fuck why, ok?
	Actually I can think of something even better to f**k if interested 
Sherma:
	Maybe it because I'm hung up on my ex and you remind me of her so I replace her with you!!! Lol
And since I can't have her I go for you cause I'm damaged and not over her 
Actually I can think of something even better to f**k if interested 

	This is what sounds most honest 
Ish:
	Maybe what's most honest is that I remind you of one of your ex (you already said that) and you are damaged and not over him 
	Either way I'm not your ex and I'll take you any way I can cuz all fair in love and war! And if I do fall for you unlike him I won't lose you! 
	Case closed! 
	Of course that'll be true if you can back up half of all the bull you say about yourself
	I'm still not sold on all the bull but am interested to find out 
	And in contrary to what you heard the only thing honest I wrote was the passage that started with ---Honestly  
	Honestly !!! I like you a lot and don't care why! Just happier that's all! And can't wait to see you Sunday cuz it will be even better then Thursday! 
	Stop being sooo negative my lady! 
	And show up Sunday and leave the training wheels and chastity belt where they belong at you ex's (the whole lot of them) doorstep
Sherma:
	If you're still around on the 10rh date, I will sleep with you 
	Training wheels been off 
Ish:
	10th date? 
	File Transfer: IMG_1080.JPG
Sherma:
	No typo, yes 10 
Ish:
	You'll give up on me before then smh
	10th date at this rate that's 10 weeks 
Sherma:
	We already had 2 dates 
Ish:
	8 more weeks that's over 2 months what poll you been reading Nuns Digest
Sherma:
	Haha, shut up
Ish:
	Apparently "why" might be question of the day! But "shut" becomes statement of our relationship for next few months 
	Spontaneous my ass smh
Sherma:
	Why? Becu I'm not easy. Question and be honest. Do you think bcuz I'm older that I'm more desperate to get laid ? 
Ish:
	Nope
	I think you can get laid at anytime where that come from ! You are a beautiful woman 
	Make a great escort as well
Sherma:
	Just want you to know that I don't just fuck anyone. You have to be someone I care about 
Ish:
	I believe you care about me my lady
	Prove it!!
	Besides, your only as old as you feel my lady. Do you feel old?
Sherma:
	I am more sexual that anyone in their 20's 
Ish:
	Let's not get carried away my lady
	I will say this from our 1st date to our 2nd date you looked about 10 years younger maybe I have positive effects on you! 
	20 year old woman don't wait to the 10th date ! Shit 60 year old woman don't wait that long smh
	Wtf
Sherma:
	20 yr old are just skanks who wants experience, I'm already there 
Ish:
	Please don't paint with such a wide brush remember your children's age 
	10th date is unnatural IMHO but it is what it is! I'm not gonna beg
	I'll just focus on Sunday and make the best of a bad situation 
	I'm happy just to make you feel younger (and look) and happier! I've done my half that's all I'm gonna focus on
	You wanna be insecure in your "I'm not easy persona" it's good! I take you for better or worse 
	Like you said earlier you worry about you me worry about me and if we make it to 10th date we worry about us ! Got it!!
Sherma:
	Referring to the 20 ur old that have at least  15-20 sexual partners 
Ish:
	Whatever 
	Way to dance around my statements 
	Only my lady can make talking about having sex depressing! Congratulations! Job well done!!
	With my luck ! I'm sure our 10th date will be April  1st. April fools day would be appropriate 
Sherma:
	So appropriate 
	Got busy, sorry 
Ish:
	Appropriate ? Son your admitting your goal is to make a joke of me ?
	Son = So
	Does my lady not care about me?
Sherma:
	I am interested in you 
	I feel something for you 
	I do like you 
Ish:
	But you don't care?
	I get it!
Sherma:
	No you don't get it 
	Why you wanna fight with me 
Ish:
	I'm not fighting believe me this isn't our first fight
	By the 10th date I'll get it! 
	I enjoy playing chess with your mind no matter how many times you bend the rules to suit your own agenda
Sherma:
	You gonna say that that I'm not a person of my word and I don't mean what I say . I'll explain, I told you that I will only fuck someone if I care about them, me saying I care and not wanting to sleep with you , means that I don't care about you a whole lot. That's how you gonna see it 
	I know how you think my lord 
Ish:
	Words are just words my lady ! Feelings and actions  are more important ! You have nothing to prove to me! Sounds like you need to prove these things to yourself! If we had sex on the 1st date or 100th date doesn't make me think any more or less of your virtue! When one is truly confident in themselves numbers and words are just what they are numbers and words that's all! Feeling and action is what motivates me. Everything else is just in the way!
	Know yourself is most important when you do what others thinks is meaningless 
	Fwiw all that is not stolen and came from me not cut and paste bullshit and never said to anyone else but you just now my lady!
	You inspire me!
	Correction - I was inspired until this 10th date decree ! If my lady's intention was to lessen my spirit she accomplished so! üëèüëç
	Thx for the reality check üòò
Sherma:
	Was on the train, getting off  in a few 
	Talk soon 
Ish:
	K
Sherma:
	Btw you will always be inspired by me and nothing will dampen that 
	Ttyl

Ish:
	Manhattan! Ok we meet at Jamaica again?
	What movie you wanna see ? You know yet
Sherma:
	We can meet at the theatre it's fine 
	13 sounds intriguing 
Ish:
	What's wrong with Jamaica?
	Is afternoon doable?
	1:25 or 4:45 showing?
Sherma:
	4.45 is better 
Ish:

Sherma:
	We could totally hang out in union square and check out a movie on 14st
Ish:
	Ill surprise you Sunday nothing earth shattering but I think you'll be pleasantly surprised
Sherma:
	I think I know what it is 
Ish:
	Whatever you want I checked the Chelsea cinema on 23rd for times 
	What is it?
Sherma:
	I'm good at ruining surprises 
	Want me to guess 
Ish:
	Please do
Sherma:
	My guess would be that you bought adidas grey sneakers with the neon green stripes 
Ish:
	If I did would that be a good surprise?
Sherma:
	Yes 
	Absolutely, means you pay attention 
Ish:
	Would it move me closer then April 1
Sherma:
	How about March 31 
Ish:
	I'll take what I can get at this point
Sherma:
	You giving up 
	Sounds like you're throwing your hands up in the air

Ish:
	I'm happy with date Sunday!

	So your now saying you didn‚Äôt mean that post?
	Who‚Äôs backing up ?
Sherma:
	I like you and also like being around you especially when you smile 
	I like the way you kiss 
Ish:
	Did that take you by surprise?
Sherma:
	Def
Ish:
	And I put a lot of hype about that! Mentioned our 1st kiss over a hundred times i bet in texts
	Haggled for more every few minutes , endless banter I did about kissing correct?
	For 2 weeks almost correct?
Sherma:
	Yea you did 
Ish:
	Did I backup the hype?
Sherma:
	Somewhat 
Ish:
	Cmon!!
	How did I not! You said it surprised you and you like how I kiss what more do I need to do
	I got more than 2 you designated and you said  you have no regrets
	How is that a ‚Äúsomewhat‚Äù ? Are you ever happy? Satisfied? 
	wtf
Sherma:
	Was looking to get a reaction outta you 
	You fall so quickly, damn 
Ish:
	Well I‚Äôm a bit on edge with the reaction and typos after 10th date incident
	I‚Äôm not serious all the time but cmon there is a time and place to be somewhat honest don‚Äôt kill all the moments
	I know your a bull and everything but cmon!!1
Sherma:
	You kissed with a lot of intensity 
	It was the kind that makes you want to take it further 
	That's all I'm gonna say on that 
Ish:
	Should I take it down a notch or two for my lady?
	You didn‚Äôt seem to mind wednesday
Sherma:
	No, I liked it a lot 
Ish:
	But I didn‚Äôt back up the hype lol
Sherma:
	I'm giving you your moment of glory 
Ish:
	You ain‚Äôt seen anything yet
	March 31st will be that moment unfortunately 
Sherma:
	Why unfortunately ?
Ish:
	Too long and a lot can change
	By no means in my mind is 3/31 a guarantee
	I‚Äôm not a fan of numbers and stuff nice it‚Äôs possible and all and you put it out there but I don‚Äôt feel I‚Äôve accomplished anything and was a bit disappointed when you said it
	took the wind out of my sails a bit
	Still care about you and all! Just don‚Äôt enjoy holding back
Sherma:
	My intent is never to hurt . You don't have to coax anything outta me. Let me surprise you one day and tell you how you've made me feel 
	Let me do it on my time 
	I mad sleepy. Not running 
	Phone is falling outta my hands 
Ish:
	GN! üòò So the 10th date plan will be reworked?
Sherma:
	10 dates and you get in 
	Nite my lord üòô
	Am falling asleep on myself 
Ish:
	Nite
Sherma:
	Hey
	Just saying hi 
	Can't really talk 
Ish:
	Hi
Sherma:
	Hi
	How are you ?
Ish:
	I'm great! And yourself?
	We still on for tommorrow?
Sherma:
	Was it. It confirmed ? 
	You wanna bail ?
Ish:
	Nope
Sherma:
	Yea it was 
Ish:
	How are you was my first question !
Sherma:
	Damn 
	I'm good, super busy 
	Are you man handling me ?
Ish:
	Let me know when you get up so we can plan accordingly
	Hell no that's not happening for quite sometime thanks to you 
Sherma:
	Got crazy shit to do, not sure what time I'll be back tonight. 
	My phone is acting up and not holding charge :(
	Will try and talk later depends on what time I get back 
	If not there's not much planning involved , just gotta show up my lord 
Ish:
	Enjoy yourself ! No problems here. Have fun my lady........I've done some thinking about it ( 10th decree) wanna know what my official response is or you too busy now and I'll tell you later or tommorow in person ? 
Sherma:
	Respond away 
	Wanna get to the shower in a few mins 
	Wanna leave by 5 
Ish:
	Your 10th decree truly inspired me my lady. To take a vow of celibacy from me to prove your virtue and how you don't sleep around is commendable to say the least! Some might say it's as hard if not harder not being intimate with me . The saying is I believe this will hurt me more than it'll hurt you 
	So I've decided to match my ladies commitment to take a vow of silence as well! To show my lady I just don't talk/text to anyone. I will text/speak/plan our many dates for the future but (and it will hurt me) no more texts otherwise! Texting to you is what I'd consider foreplay and since no play is in the foreseeable future that's my decree . A vow of silence to show my lady how much I care about those I text repeatedly! 
	Dates I will show up when scheduled atleast 1 per week hopefully and they will be great! But someone once said its better to miss the person or create the desire to see them so it's good not to see(now text) frequently
	Enjoy your day my lady! Can't wait to see and talk tommorrow !
	File Transfer: IMG_1410.jpeg
Sherma:
	That was some spiel, don't believe a word, if I had the time I would prove to you that it's all bs. So anyways my
Lord, I will talk later 
	File Transfer: IMG_0337.PNGDon't talk/text silence works for me 
	File Transfer: IMG_0337.PNGDon't talk/text silence works for me

Sherma:

Ish:
	Whoo hoo!!

Sherma:
	Nah, got home at 3.30 
Ish:
	Go back to bed then don't want you yawning all time with me
Sherma:
	Thought you not talking 
Ish:
	These are date related questions
	Just protecting my investment and interests
	3 gets me closer to 10 correct?
	Supposed to be nice today some forecasts have it being 50 degrees was hoping could get an earlier start get some sun 
	Also I'm not doing this vow of silence to be difficult just playing your game apparently games are your specialty 
	But on date days I have no problem chatting about it and making the day as perfect as it can be all things considered of course
	Oh no you fall out already üò©
	üí§üí§üí§üí§
Sherma:
	I'm here , we could start earlier, okay by me

Sherma:
	Okay I will 
	Get home safely and thanks for today 
Ish:
	You are very welcome! Thanks for showing up and putting up with me for the 3rd time. Almost home phone battery low. Sorry about the spam just doing my best to plead my case! Hopefully something will appeal to my lady's fair and kind side! Good Night! Hope to hear good news soon or a day we can see eachother! Can't wait for either! You will be missed ! TTYL üòçüòò
	Just checking in .... You ok?
	File Transfer: IMG_4026.jpegRemember me?
	File Transfer: IMG_4026.jpegRemember me?
	Really?
Sherma:
	So I've decided to abide by my lord commitment to take a vow of silence!!!  To show my lord I just don't talk/text to anyone. I will text/speak/plan our many dates for the future but (and it will hurt me) no more texts otherwise! Your rules 
Ish:
	So your ok I suppose.  When I looked outside this morning and saw the darks skies figured you might be blue 
	Just checking ....... Asking for a status report that's all! Don't want you to think my heart is as cold as yours!
	Any idea when that next date is gonna be? Trying my best to keep my schedule open 
	Glad you know how to copy and paste 
	I see you enjoy this battle of wills! Guess you haven't reconsidered your 10th date decree unconstitutional law!
Sherma:
	I'm just better at it my lord and your guess is correct 
	I'm doing fine, Thz for asking 
	How are you ?
Ish:
	Good to hear! That's all I wanted ... 
	I'm not as good as you apparently!
Sherma:
	Getting on the subway, will loose you soon 
	No response = no service 
Ish:
	I'm fine.... I'll admit there is a void I feel when we don't communicate but in my souls I feel its the right thing to do until you compromise with me and let me fill your void
	Atleast 1 of us is willing to be fair and honest smh
	You are sooo wrong with this and it bothers me that you won‚Äôt compromise‚Ä¶. it drives me crazy I don‚Äôt get the benefit of the doubt from you‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ I guess I was wrong about us ‚Ä¶..
	Unlike you I admit when I make a mistake.
	Then again like you said earlier whenever you start to feel something you push them away!!! Congrats! 
Sherma:
	The right thing is always what you feel within your soul. 
What exactly is it that you're compromising?  I'm I wrong because I'm not ready to sleep with you? Or is it wrong for you to me reconsider my position 
	I'm not cold just cautious 
Ish:
	Your wrong to put your feelings on a number of dates
	I was wrong about us since you wanna treat us like some math problem‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ 10 dates why? Cuz that‚Äôs what you do for everyone? I‚Äôm not everyone 
	I feel like your treating my like I‚Äùm some 40yr old player or bachelor who beds woman for sport
	That‚Äôs soo far from the truth‚Ä¶.. 
	Your the one who‚Äôs had two boyfriends since your husband not me‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ 
	I don‚Äôt wanna and refuse to be treated like them, not happening‚Ä¶. This isn‚Äôt some college application or job interview process
	Any relationship needs to be 50/50‚Ä¶ why do you get the right to make such an important decision without my input!
	It makes me feel powerless and I don‚Äôt like feeling that‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs unfair and it‚Äôs not indicative of how our relationship is progressing.
	Things are going great you know that why create conflict? I don‚Äôt understand
	Definition of cautios = (of a person) careful to avoid potential problems or dangers.
	All I feel your doing by the 10th date decrees is causing problems and dangers‚Ä¶
	How‚Äôs that being cautious? by hurting me?
	Rather hurt me first then get hurt?
	Does a man buy a new hat and matching shoes cuz he‚Äôs interested in deceiving you?
	What of my actions doesn‚Äôt earn your trust or benefit of the doubt? It makes no sense‚Ä¶.
	You have the nerve to tell me I‚Äôm still interested in my ex, yet your‚Äôs is your best friend and your‚Äôs other in another state at the moment maybe coming back who knows? But it‚Äôs quite possible if he was in NY you‚Äôd be shagging him.  Yet I‚Äôm the one you don‚Äôt trust and wanna wait another few months when everything is going absolutely perfect!!! Why???
	It makes no sense‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ 
	When something doesn‚Äôt make sense it usually isn‚Äôt true!
	Honestly fwiw I‚Äôm not angry (maybe a lil‚Ä¶ LOL) more disappointed if any with you‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt like feeling disappointed by you‚Ä¶.. Im hoping better from you‚Ä¶.. throw out your dating manual with me my lady‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
Sherma:
	All of this because I haven't spoken to you in 2 days or agree to change the terms of the agreement.
Won't like to know how you really feel if you're angry since this is just you being disappointed. 
	I am completely drenched and cold. Didn't take a jacket or an umbrella to work. Just got in, can I wake a hot bubble bath before I talk to you 
Ish:
	Sure, no problem.  This has all to do with 10th date nonsense.
	Enjoy your bath‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not resentful at all you didn‚Äôt talk to me for 2 days I knew you wouldn‚Äôt give in, if anything it reconfirms how serious you‚Äôll take this 10th date thing unless reason creeps into your soul
	Shit‚Ä¶. you‚Äôd still be sitting with me on those steps if it wasn‚Äôt for me‚Ä¶ think how drenched you‚Äôd be then
	And you wanna wait 7 more dates/weeks. Not happening
Sherma:
	Don't respond till I'm done 
First and foremost I want you to understand that my ex is very, very important to me. You don't get to throw shit back in my face when I've been honest about my life. It is petty and childlike. 
You're clearly not upset about us not talking but more so about us not having sex. If that's priority right now for you, I already told you that I have no problems with you sleeping with someone else. We are not a couple, we are seeing each other and enjoying each other's company.  
	Feel free to be with whom ever you choose to be with, I have no right to dictate to you or ask for you to wait 
Ish:
	Not to cut you off , which ex? You have 3
Sherma:
	Nice !! , referring to my best friend... You're probably right about my ex from Cali, there was never any closure with that relationship. So maybe I'm hang up a little on him but not once did I lie about it 
	When I'm with you, I'm with you !!!
	My ex husband I really don't give a Fxxx about 
Ish:
	Done? Can I respond? Floor is yours don‚Äôt wanna interrupt if your in middle of thought
Sherma:
	Done 
	I have to pick up my daughter when she calls. Just giving you a heads up 
	Which will be in a few I guess 
	Floor is all yours 
Ish:
	I‚Äôm upset not about us not having sex but how long it is down the road.  That‚Äôs just cruel
	It‚Äôs not petty if it bothers me sorry you feel that way
	If you don‚Äôt feel like that towards me is one thing. But that‚Äôs clearly not the case.
	You just wanna torture me it seems make me pass some ridiculous test.
	I‚Äôm not interested in just sex with someone else, you think I‚Äôm that shallow
	What if we went on 2 dates a week?  Does that change anything or is it the 8 weeks you need not dates, the whole science behind this just perplexes me.
	You don‚Äôt even have it figured it out‚Ä¶.. like your some dating aficionado or something plz ‚Ä¶.. Why can‚Äôt it be when it feels right not all structured and all
	And I don‚Äôt like thinking negative things about you and us‚Ä¶.. and thats what this creates‚Ä¶ I feel its not a good recipe for long term success and I feel that‚Äôs what your doing is sabotaging us‚Ä¶. seriously your last two relationships were 6mo‚Äôs and 3 or 4 mo‚Äôs and you want me to wait 3 months for what?
	It‚Äôs just sex, OMG‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. its part of any healthy relationship and if your willing to do it (you said your are) why wait sooooooo long? I‚Äôm not like meat? I hope I don‚Äôt gross you out‚Ä¶
	Feel free to respond anytime don‚Äôt wanna say too much so you just avoid my points
	Also while your still speechless don‚Äôt be shy to check my new tinder profile, I changed it just for you lol!!
	Why torture yourself &(twin)?
Sherma:
	It's never my intention to torture anyone. It's a 2 month thing I have with the relationships I've had. I don't mean to make you feel less, it's that to need to be more. I don't want sexy to be the only thing that's driving this relationship.. It has to be us 
	I'm sorry but I'm not running away as you may put it 
	But I have to go pick up my girls 
	Will try and talk when I get back. I promise 
	Ttyl 
	Bye
Ish:
	Get back yet? Home safe?
Sherma:
	Am here 
Ish:
	Change your mind?
Sherma:
	About ?
Ish:
	You earlier said 2 months we matched on 1/7 so March 7 is our new target date, correct?
	And still it's 100% your sole reason to torture me (and indirectly you )
	Chemistry dictates sex ! Plain and simple!
	Trust I agree is a factor but chemistry especially for you of a strong mind is affected by trust
	And our chemistry without a doubt 100% is off the charts
	Sooo cuz of you and your rules have made our relationship all about sex and the sad thing is that we are not having it is the elephant in the room. Not the actual act! Sad!!
	Sorry to say but it's true I'm 100% sober and unlike you refuse to be in denial
	When I deny my heart and feelings it physically hurts me thx my lady
	Your used to hurting yourself Mrs 80 pounds why me now
	I'm that overweight?
	Hellooooooooo?
You there?
Sherma:
	Listening 
	Reading 
	Why do you want me ?
Ish:
	Does the answer matter? Is it gonna change anything?
Sherma:
	It's only been a month 
	You can't have deep rooted feeling 
	It's just pent up sexual desire that's feeding you 
Ish:
	A very good month...... My feelings aren't on a clock like yours
	You want me just as much I'm not in denial you are
	Do you kiss all your dates like me after 3 dates?
	Do you send all your friends pictures? If so how many!
	Do all your acquaintance make you uneasy?
Sherma:
	I don't kiss and tell 
Ish:
	Whatever 
	Such a convenient answer
Sherma:
	Well suited, won't you say 
Ish:
	I'm not really in a joking mood tbh
	I do enjoy the fact I feel comfortable enough to say this to you sober and all.... But it's just as upsetting I even need to
	After two days of silence I'd hoped you would take me a lil bit more serious but apparently not smh
	Do what you want! I guess I'll just have to accept it or leave! Your way or the highway great way to write a love story
	I know it's all about whether "I stick around" üò©üò©üò©üò©üò©üò©
Sherma:
	I don't know what you want or expect from me ? You will never understand the kind of love I had for my husband and it shattered me. Love shattered me !! I'm trying but someone it's not enough for you 
	Yes there's no denial, I am broken 
	And you're not the fixing type 
Ish:
	You sure seem fine with me
	Other then this 10th decree we are great!
	You know how lucky you are to meet me?
	Why fuck around with that ???
	Seriously if I didn't think it would be appropriate I wouldn't act like this 
	You are a good woman Sherma! No question in my mind 
	You got a good heart! Good spirit but after this 10th decree I'm questioning your moral compass?
	Not sure if your testing me or not and it's frustrating 
	If your goal is tonmake me wait the longest or something you've made your point .... And if you don't think I respect you .... That's total nonsense as well
	And if your telling me your not feeling that way yet towards me your lying 
	Sex is next on the menu whether you like it or not... Maybe not immediately next but a lot sooner then your acting 
	Otherwise it's gonna wear on us
	Sorry ...... It'll wear on me 
	You maybe not your so numb to pain it appears
	Mrs discipline and stubborn u r
	And about your love for your husband the one you say you don't give a fuck about anymore..... That's everyone I could say the same and I'm sure my ex would say it as well and maybe yours too ......
	You didn't seem too broke last 3 dates it's almost like you don't wanna let it go with this 10th decree and all
	It's like we're at the climax of the movie and you wanna hit the pause button and wait 7 weeks to watch it
	Wtf
Sherma:
	Remember in the beginning I said I don't wanna get hurt, do you recall what you're response was ?
Ish:
	What was it?
Sherma:
	That maybe you (Artie ) might be the one getting hurt 
Ish:
	Lol! You said you were gonna break my heart 
	I won't get hurt if we wait .... It hurts waiting and it makes me like you less 
	But you've said we'd do it ! Not an issue just arguing the truth and that's on my side
	And I trust your word !! Don't think your playing me there
Sherma:
	Am not playing you 
Ish:
	Timing is very important ..... And your tone deaf here trust me!!
	This isn't normal hookup ...... Normal for me maybe but not you
	We've know each other all too well I'm sure of it
	I'm doing this for yours and mine best interests
	If you wanna wait after the first time I'll understand but not 7 more dates or week way too long 
	Week = weeks
	Have you seen my new tinder profile?
	Still there sorry if I tapped you out...
Sherma:
	Still here 
Ish:
	Nothing to say? Think I'm crazy I guess
	Sorry now you know why I had to take vow of silence cuz if I really believe something I can be relentness tough for me to give up
	I really believe what I'm say it's not a desperate man who needs a piec
	Piece 
	Not my style don't think of you like that and I shouldn't have to prove it  for another 7 weeks
	Chemistry is too hot and I don't really wanna tone it down or back off 
	I will if I have too but I don't believe you wanna either
	It's really a formality IMHO a 7 weeks formality is the frustrating part honestly 
	Tell me I'm wrong? I'm all ears
Sherma:
	I'm not tone deaf and I don't get the frustration but that's how you feel and I'm not minimizing it 
Ish:
	Fact!! In case your paying attention we either touched , caressed or kissed eachother the whole time we were together Sunday except when we were visible in the movie theatre and those few mins were torture lol
	I know you don't kiss and tell I'm sure your like that with all your me smh
	Me = men
Sherma:
	You gonna think whatever you wanna think, regardless 
	And yes I'm quite aware of what transpired between us 
Ish:
	What does that mean..... 7 more hot dates like that until we're together cmon!!
Sherma:
	Could you not just be with me without counting down ?
	Don't know what I'm looking for in tinder 
	Side note 
Ish:
	I'm not tinder we are way past that bullshit
	You made this a numbers game not me
	Only thing I threw out was Valentine's Day 
	And average couple is less then 4 dates
	We are way above average 
	We should be celebrating our meeting not white knuckling for 2 months 
	Have I made any sense at all to you ?
Sherma:
	You've made your point quite obvious 
Ish:
	Is there any substance to it in your opinion ?
Sherma:
	From your perspective I could see it 
Ish:
	So I made no dent in your decree?
Sherma:
	Slight dents 
	No serious damage 
	But I will be more open to the possibility 
Ish:
	In your math what does that mean?
	7 dates , 7 weeks , please give me something 
Sherma:
	I hate it when you want me to be exact 
Ish:
	Am I going to be able to see you this week?
	If it's not exact I feel I'm never gonna get it
	Only way I feel is to pin you down 
	Sad but true
	You are a piece of work l think you enjoy the delay
Sherma:
	I'm not enjoying anything right now 
Ish:
	Lol
	Then give in to me !
Sherma:
	Please don't put so much pressure on me to commit to a date 
Ish:
	Honestly when it comes to you I've been looking so far past our first time that's it's crazy I've had to spend all this energy focusing on it
Sherma:
	Why ??
Ish:
	But I can't until we get past it
	Why what?
Sherma:
	Why so you spend all that enemy focusing on having sex
Ish:
	Cuz you said it's not happening for 7 dates
	That's why
Sherma:
	It makes me feel like that's all you want from me 
Ish:
	Sex is one of the most natural things in world
	You made it unnatural and I wanna respect your wishes
	Please never ever ever had a conversation like this lol
	Someone I really care about anyway
	I want you take me serious that's all and understand its 50/50 so I don't feel appreciated
	I don't want this to end for me and what your doing is raining on it!! That's all lol! It's not the sex........ It's the precedence it sets
	Sound crazy?
Sherma:
	It seems like you're the one fanning the fire and not me raining on it 
Ish:
	I sure fanned the fire when I pulled you off the steps 
	I had the fire hose then
	Don't plan on using it for another 7 weeks
	Let's not digress from the facts 
Sherma:
	I want to be intimate with you but I don't want to be feel like I'm only doing it bcuz you're getting bored and don't know how long you would stick around 
	It won't be 7 dates okay 
	Just let me do it on my own 
Ish:
	Fair enough my lady 
Sherma:
	Let me feel like I'm in charge of my body 
Ish:
	None of this on my own shit
	Put the porn away u got me now
	I'm much better! Have faith!!
	If you were in charge of your body we'd have gone to gem motel lady date 
Sherma:
	I would have let you know 
	After kissing you I would have suggested it 
Ish:
	No you wouldn't cuz you don't wanna go past your 10 dates or 2 months or 90 day rules
	Whatever it is you know better then me
Sherma:
	You can't be falling for me. We already established that 
Ish:
	I'm totally falling for you ! What you talking about
	I'm not lonely at all yet I spend all this time with you cmon that's something!
	I just know myself and when things start feeling bad I need to address it
	Usually in past I'd go get drunk and who knows what happens but with you it was awesome to deal with sober with all my faculties
	And trust me if we were a drinking couple I'd wouldn't have to worry about date decrees or nothing
	We would get drunk and fuck like rabbits lol
	Then I'd be in damage control cuz the other party feels kinda violated how it happened so fast lol
	Mix alcohol with my passion good things usually happen for me
	Did you read my tinder profile yet?
Sherma:
	Screenshot for me 
	Could we end tonight on a good note, don't like fighting 
Ish:
	File Transfer: IMG_1095.PNG
	Thanks for inspiring me
	Some things are worth fighting for! Be glad or honored my lady that I consider you to be of such value
	Like my new profile ?
Sherma:
	Very eye catching 
	Sounds like ur official 
Ish:
	Already got a match got her down to 8th date lol
	When I get her under 7 your a goner
Sherma:
	Yea yea yea 
Ish:
	Where was that on Sunday when I was asking to go to gem ?
	See My humor back my lady?
	Did I upset you at all today?
Sherma:
	So is mine ... Amma  goner sleep soon 
	You pushed my buttons 
Ish:
	You started
	Did it surprise you at all i held to my guns for two days?
Sherma:
	I knew you would cave 
	But you did held out, so yea 
Ish:
	Did you miss me at all? Even a lil bit?
Sherma:
	I did last nite but I'm way to stubborn to give in 
Ish:
	Any chance you would've caved?
Sherma:
	I'm a Taurus 
	But honestly I did miss you 
Ish:
	Not enough to change the decree 
Sherma:
	Shhhhhh
Ish:
	Missed you too but the longer it went on the longer I felt I'd grow apart
	Started thinking bad things and becoming negative to keep away and it's not what I wanted 
	I knew the dates would still be electric but didn't like my state of consciousness 
Sherma:
	You have to be okay with or without me 
	Remember that 
Ish:
	I'm fine. Like I said I didn't go get drunk or anything 
	That's priceless! Honestly I don't think you truly comprehend who your with yet! 
	After the bedding ceremony maybe it'll start to sink in
Sherma:
	
And you underestimate who I am 
Ish:
	Not at all
	I know you all too well 
Sherma:
	Okay my lord 
Ish:
	We good my lady?
Sherma:
	It's my time to tap out 
Ish:
	When am I gonna see you again?
Sherma:
	Probably Saturday
	Only day I have available 
Ish:
	Ok I'll keep that day open! 
	You gonna be more open now my lady so I can break my vow?
	Both agree to break our vows ?
Sherma:
	Will make an attempt 
Ish:
	Listen your word is gold with me 
	Give me
Something I can believe in
Sherma:
	Don't like that word " listen"
Ish:
	Don't like work NO - you use it all time 
	Work = word
Sherma:
	No 
	I don't 
Ish:
	Listen
Sherma:
	I hate it with a passion 
	It's belittling 
	Control attached to it 
Ish:
	Can you please my lady give me something in writing that I can believe the 10th decree has been repealed thx
Sherma:
	Don't use it 
Ish:
	I won't
	I trust you! Make me happy 
	Sorry I don't give up and I'm not trying to start another fight
Sherma:
	In your profile you said I will make you happier than you've ever been 
	Make me happy 
	Ier
Ish:
	I do make you happier!
	If I didn't know with all my heart the bedding ceremony would make you happier then you ever been I wouldn't insist
Sherma:
	Artie when you and I get together it's going to be amazing 
	Don't push for it, it will happen when you least expect it 
Ish:
	Promise?
Sherma:
	Yes 
Ish:
	Good Night my lady !!!
Sherma:
	You can do me as many times as you like 
	And in any position 
	Let it just  happen 
Ish:
	Good Night my lady!  Time will tell I suppose ! Can't wait.... Will do my best not to explode before!
Sherma:
	I need to sleep now, nite 
	K
	Nite 
Ish:
	Lol!  Your too much and you wanted to wait 7 weeks! Everything you told me I kinda already knew! But it's still music to my ears!
	üò¥üí§üí§üí§
	Thanks again! Mark this post! Last time I'll ever bring up the F word again!
Sherma:
	Can't chat but saying hi 
	Hi 
Ish:
	Hi
Sherma:
	You good ?
Ish:
	Yes! Are you?
	I'm happier now with us.
	Sorry about last few days ...... They say a woman should be with a guy who messes up their lipstick not mascara ! Sunday I was the first hopefully I wasn't the latter the last few daysüòò
Sherma:
	I don't wear mascara :) 
	VM sent by mistake 
Ish:
	Np .... Whether you wear it or not I hope you get the point and accept my apology
Sherma:
	I'll chuck it up to you having your period 
	Lol
Ish:
	üò´
	Hey we got thru our first lil fight no casualties hopefully our next one is for quite some time
	I hope my point earlier of rowing the same way hit home a lil bit my lady
	I know it's not a sprint but somethings are worth running for! Fwiw you stole my word 'amazing' last nite! Maybe we really are twins 
	I also meant what I said about "F" word ! I'm done !
Sherma:
	I get what you're saying, we won't agree on every issue but I'm open minded 
Ish:
	Sure fooled me
	Time will tell
Sherma:
	Didn't say I would give in, "hullo" just open minded 
Ish:
	Your stubborness is what scares me
Sherma:
	That's what attracted you to me, yes??
Ish:
	Your complexion of course lol
	I like your personality as much as your beauty
	I like the fact I'm not nervous about holding back 
	I want you to fall for me whereas in past acquaintances it was more primal and rehearsed
	I still don't think you can handle me but with your stubborness you seem up to try and that's maybe the only thing I like about your stubborness my lady
	Lol! The silver lining in it all after must introspection 
	I couldn't find any silver in 10th decree unfortunately my lady why I had to protest
Sherma:
	I honestly like this more than fighting
Ish:
	Me too! I tried to foreshadow this you guess you didn't get the hint 
	This to you ***
	Or maybe your ego got better of you and your underestimate me my lady
	Either way glad it's over ! Sooooo glad my lady
	I reread the texts last nite and at one point I said something to the fact -" I'm not really in a joking mood" -- WOW! That could be a first for that to ever say that to another Adult ! Lol!! 
	That = me
	Time will tell if it was all for naught 
	Whether you were being mendacious or not about our new understanding
	Regardless ATM I'm much happier hope you are too my lady!
	Smooth sailing ‚õµÔ∏è
	Just like it was prior to the event ‚õµÔ∏è‚õµÔ∏è‚õµÔ∏è‚õµÔ∏è
	Rowing together correct?
Sherma:
	I could deal with disagreement as long as you see it my way  ... " no joking mood ? "
Ish:
	Are you trying to start something ?
Sherma:
	Nope 
Ish:
	Rowing together correct?
Sherma:
	Yes my lord 
	Damn you difficult 
Ish:
	That's my lady üòò
Sherma:
	My patient is jerking off 
	Fuck 
Ish:
	Too much info... Maybe it's you my lady you wanted me jerking off for another 2 months
	You have that affect apparently my lady
Sherma:
	They like the exotic look 
Ish:

Sherma:
	Not funny 
Ish:
	Sorry! Never say never those are your words not mine!
	No expectations as well that's what she used to say to me as well
	Actually the term was no commitments no obligations to be perfectly honest
	She played that game at first until I found out she was still with this guy and walked away!!
	Then reality set in ..... Just sharing the truth and maybe explains why I react certain way I did with us and this 0 expectations theme
	Didn't realize the parallels until last few days 
	It didn't take her body to warm up as slow but she was younger then 
	Not comparing of course
Sherma:
	I don't wanna fight 
Ish:
	Fighting over my lady 
Sherma:
	Am just not gonna respond 
Ish:
	Just sharing a truthful experience thought you like to know me better 
	My lil digs might be inappropriate but please no offense meant 
	I'm cool ! Am just letting you know not intimidated by any Dr
	I have proof and a beautiful son to prove it
	And she doesn't regret her choice ( you can ask her one day if u stick around) just saying if course
	I hope not anyway

Sherma:
	File Transfer: Current Location.loc.vcf
Ish:
	Didn't know you were at work my bad !! No 7:30 til 3:30 thought you were home
	I thought what you said to me was a low blow but after re-reading it didn't realize I might've offended you 
	Was just joking didn't mean to strike a nerve if I did ! But you definitely Did with me! It's water under the bridge 
	For the future it's not a good idea to tell a man you haven't slept with how well the previous man you slept with was 
	For the future almost everything with me is fair game a better and more thoughtful response would've been well atleast he had his own place least I can say for you ........ Low but honest is fine with me low and bullshit isn't !! Food for thought !! 
	A doctor and a nurse what an orginal idea for a love story !!!
	Fwiw - all kidding aside I apologize I hope my lady the bull does as well üêÇüôè
	Row forward? Ok
Sherma:
	I'm good 
Ish:
	No apology ?
Sherma:
	No , why ??
Ish:
	Are u serious?
	Your not gonna apologize ?
	So you meant what you said?
Sherma:
	Apologize Becuz I said "You could fuck your self, no offense "
Ish:
	About how you said the dr know how to deliver and I don't that's why u reciprocated  
	You can't be that tone deaf
	Have u read anything I posted
Sherma:
	Recap, never said you can't 
Ish:
	You haven't reciprocated with me
	Connect the dots
	Why even go there 
Sherma:
	You went there 
Ish:
	No I didn't 
	I brought up your low sex drive that's all
	I was going after you not him
	You owe me an apology
	You will never be able to make fun of my sex drive if so go ahead I'll find it hilarious cuz I know the truth 
	You apparently can't 
Sherma:
	STOP !!!
Ish:
	Please apologize it's simple 
Sherma:
	You gonna say something you can't take back 
Ish:
	If I offend you I will take back anything 
	I'm not built that way
	I will apologize and apologize before hand for offending u
	You offended me and I almost never get offended 
	You won't apologize seriously? You are that thick?
	Would you like me to talk about my ex's sex life? Cmon I have too much wisdom not too
	Especially when we never had sex never!!
	Only time in English language to use never
	Eating out ATM and Friday I'm in love is playing lol
	And right before I called you lovesong by cure as well was playing 
	Made me call u
	Lol! Not a bad scene in a Hollywood love story 
	Just apologize pick your times to push back now isn't that time 
Sherma:
	Waiting for you to finish, didn't wanna interrupt 
	Not for one second did I imply that you didn't deliver , want to make it perfectly clear 
	U remark had to do with low sex drive and meds. My reply was he delivered and I reciprocated, didn't need any stimulation 
	U=ur
	It has/had nothing to do with you 
	The floor is yours 
Ish:
	Your not gonna apologize ?
	?
Sherma:
	I don't know the reason for the apology but if I've offended you I sincerely apologize 
Ish:
	Better
	Now
	The whole point of the joke I was making was about the 10th date 90!day 2 month riel
	Rules
	You set but if all the dr had to do was deliver that's a whole different story
	I've been 1000000% respecting these rules you set but what all the DR has to do is deliver and you reciprocate 
	See my point ?
	Wtf
	Sorry I didn't go to med school and bottom fish on my subordinate 
	Glad you apologized regardless why you don't know why is a bit puzzling 
	But someday we will get all this nonsense out of the way and never look back lol
	Floor is yours my lady
	When your not busy ofcourse 
Sherma:
	I'd i wanted to be with Chris I would have move to Cali. I chose differently and that path lead me to you. 
	I'm not asking you to be anyone but yourself 
Ish:
	Sounds like if you didn't have your daughter you might've
	I also said in my profile not too settle 
	Don't want my lady to settle that's all
	I will always be myself don't worry was saying it sarcastically lol
	Are you happy the path lead you too me?
Sherma:
	I don't second guess my choices. I am only looking ahead and it's not easy but my past have dictated my present. I want differently and hopefully my present will dictate my future. 
Ish:
	Well said
Sherma:
	I don't have a crystal  ball and I can't say if this is going to work out but today I'm happy 
	I just wanna be thankful for that 
Ish:
	Then let's make love Saturday get it over with 
	If it's gonna happen let it
	I'd rather plan the 1st time it feels right in this instance 
	Surprises and when you least expect it isn't appropriate we talk sooo much we should decide together 
	Beside I like when you said " on the 10th date you get in" or "10th date you get to hit it" gives me goosebumps 
	Sooo tell me "On Saturday I will be your lunch on the well go to spotted pig for dessert" 
	The well = then we'll 
	On = and
	Deal?
Sherma:
	Don't wanna pop your bubble 
	You don't have to plan every aspect 
Ish:
	We do since neither of us have a place

	Hate to leave you after the first time 
	Sucks we can't sleepover  and shit together but it's more appropriate considering our current situation 
	Sex then date

	And it's awesome to be in live together afterwards glowing 
	It's = it'd 
	Live = public

	Amazing = Saturday, ok my lady?üôè
Sherma:
	Least expect it doesn't have a day attached to it . Before telling you all of this I clearly said I would think about the "L" thingy nothing more 
Ish:
	Fine, but where this 8th date shit come from then?
Sherma:
	Got work to do so I won't be able to respond in a timely manner 
Ish:
	Fine, but you can‚Äôt tell me all this about your confession and then not be with me‚Ä¶.. How can you feel comfortable enough ( I appreciate it) to tell me this but not complete the act.
	Otherwise we‚Äôre just kidding ourselves.
	The doubt will always be there. Saturday it is my lady its‚Äô a no brainer and I can‚Äôt wait! Please agree üôè
	Talk is over‚Ä¶.
	Enough of the games already‚Ä¶.lol!
Sherma:
	It was me letting you know what to expect 
Ish:
	I agree for Saturday
	I understand a lot more don‚Äôt hold it against your for keeping it a secret
Sherma:
	Please don't push for it when I'm clearly not ready 
Ish:
	When you gonna be ready‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. nothing is gonna change except you trying to get me to quit
Sherma:
	Let me okay with it. Please 
Ish:
	If its gonna happen it‚Äôs gonna happen where you with your other ex‚Äôs with same variables?
	Listen you gotta get through this and its unfair to me what your doing‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. getting me to start to fall for  you then telling me to walk
	You are obviously scared and hesitating like I said before this knowledge and its wrong‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt be like this
	If you care for me don‚Äôt do this to me
Sherma:
	What about me Artie ?
Ish:
	What about you‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. your feeling insecure about yourself I assure you , you won‚Äôt after Saturday
	Otherwise fear manifests and it‚Äôll ruin us‚Ä¶. its already started and I knew it was something , unfortunately until now I didn‚Äôt know what the problem was,  now that I do I‚Äôll work on fixing (yes I can fix ) it Saturday
	Best way to get in pool is to jump right in, not dip toe in water my lady!
	And Im the warmest pool you;ll ever swim in
	You with me my lady?
	We gonna shake the heavens Saturday?
	I promise to take it easy on you the first few times‚úåÔ∏è
	you there? tap out or too busy
Sherma:
	The original plan stands, you ask if Saturday could be the "L" day after thinking about it, I will agree to it. I don't want the heavenly regions singing nor to hear that the planet has conspired to bring us together. It's not a 2 for 1 special. Just let it be and happen naturally without me feeling like I only did it bcuz of you. Could you stop being you for a moment and be me , that's all I'm asking 
Ish:
	You are agreeing tomorrow to "do" it? Thanks my lady
	You will not be disappointed 
Sherma:
	Can't talk right now, I'm a bit late as is 
Ish:
	Np so we good for tommorrow?
	Sorry damn you busy and out here we got a good amount of snow be careful 
	Just wanted to call and verify your last text to me could be construed two ways and wanted to hear your true thoughts and feelings first hand cuz I do care about them
	But I'll admit I do feel a lil deceived by you and your insecurities do weigh on me too fwiw ..... I'm very empathetic if you remember and do have a 6th sense in these instances 
	Funny I've been trying to get you "out of your head" all this time rightfully so but for the wrong reasons .... Now I know more it will be more natural. I do appreciate your confession and all it means a lot but the better time to tell me would've been right around the time you made the 10th decree which hurt me (cuz I couldn't understand it and it felt unnatural) then instead of confessing to me after more sexual pressure I applied on you! But this you (we) need to get through or we are its gonna cause a great schism soo consider that please! You have the interests of a great guy 1 in a billion make him happy, it will make you happy! Notice I said happy not happier cuz no matter how you slice it , if one don't feel comfortable in their own skin they can be truly happy! I don't care what you say ..... You say your all about the truth just giving you my version and beliefs , all things being said I've been the more honest person in this relationship and that should account for something .... Everything I mean everything you've asked for I've tried to give you all I ask is for a lil reciprocity thx my lady!! Natural is my middle name ! üòò Have a good morning those are my thoughts And you don't even owe me a penny! Be safe! 
	Eliminate "we are" before schism comment thx
	Can = can't before "truly happy"
	And...... New flash the difference between making the "L" versus the "F" is one is done for you and one is done for the partner ... You can ( as you clearly said to me already) "F" yourself but you can't make "L" to yourself .... So yes I insist you do the becuz of me wouldn't want it any other way lol! Thanks for making my argument for me ur the best my lady. 
Sherma:
	All I'm agreeing to is spending time with you. 
Making out (LM)  ‚úÖ 
Having sex  ‚ùå 
No miscommunication 
 
	Can't talk for the next couple hrs 
	Btw good morning 
Ish:
	Good Morning! My lady! 
	So is sex undecided or totally off the menu?
	What does lm mean?
	LM = love making I'm hoping 
Sherma:
	Off the menu my twin for sat 
Ish:
	How can something happen naturally then if it's off the table 
	This is bullshit! Why you constantly gotta fight me on everything 
	I'm finding it harder and harder to trust your feelings or intentions with us
	Not happy 
	Natural and you seem polar oppposites
	Why we fighting over a formality 
Sherma:
	You are, not me 
	Not tomorrow that's all I'm saying 
Ish:
	Because I'm being deceived I feel nothing about this is natural that's my whole point
	Sherma what did you think about my points I made since last nite? How am I not getting what I want? What am I doing wrong
	Why won't you give me what I deserve !
	Why would you recommend me to walk!
Sherma:
	For the past few days all I hear is what you deserve. Work with me and if you can't, you can't 
	I always leave the door open, at any point you wanna take the exit, I'll show it to you 
	Don't wanna keep someone who doesn't wanna stay 
Ish:
	It appears that's what you want me to do
	I don't understand why 
	You even stated yesterday "didn't think you last this long"
	Wtf
	You say you want something to happen natural and in next breath saying it ain't happening tommorrow 
	How can that be honest ?
	You stated the look of disappointment on my face was priceless is this a game to you ? 
	After our first date 
	I do have feelings for you I will not lie and I truly believe they are mutual but I said during our 2nd date things will get better why aren't they? It frustrates me
	If you really and truly want things to happen naturally I'm perfect with that but it seems no matter what happens you won't allow it to happen
	Why did you reciprocate with the Dr and not me? It hurts even more what u said
	How did you feel about your body with your last two relationships?
	Last thing...... Sorry about this
	But I'd rather talk about this thru text cuz it's more private then subway and stuff 
	In a perfect world we could talk it out in person but make the best of this situation turn lemons into lemonade 
	Floor is yours 
	When ur not busy that is
	We talk/text too much to not come to some agreement reason I still have faith in us
	?
Sherma:
	It appears the way you perceive it to be, is that you got a raw deal. Based on deception and frustration, together with dishonesty and bipolar advancement. 
I don't like to be told what to do, when and how it's gonna happen. 
Ish:
	Lol! 
	If You don‚Äôt like being told what to do and when it‚Äôs gonna happen why you doing it to me my twin
Sherma:
	If I'm worth it you would wait, it's not a sprint to the finish line.  
Ish:
	4th date isn‚Äôt a sprint my lady its average
	And again, If You don‚Äôt like being told what to do and when it‚Äôs gonna happen why you doing it to me my twin
Sherma:
	I'm asking for you to respect my wishes, not a lot to ask from my lord 
Ish:
	Have I respected them so far?
	If I didn‚Äôt care about or respect my lady‚Äôs wishes why would I argue so fervently about them, also when do my wishes matter>
	> = ?
Sherma:
	Your wishes do matter 
Ish:
	Yea yea yea just not Tommorrow
Sherma:
	You got it , see you're getting me more and more 
Ish:
	Got what?
Sherma:
	The not tomorrow :)
Ish:
	Whatever glad your having fun with this smiley! 
	I'm done complaining you win I lose 
Sherma:
	File Transfer: FullSizeRender.jpg
	No one looses my twin, you get to see me tomorrow 
	Hold my hand, kiss my lips and my neck 
Ish:
	i know 
	I‚Äôm just hurt what can i say ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. just expressing my feelings 
	not a bad consolation prize i must admit 
	i too don‚Äôt like being told what i can and can‚Äôt do 
	Appears my lady is a hypocrite
	her twin isn‚Äôt
Sherma:
	You build me up then break me down
Ish:
	likewise
	Sad thing is I‚Äôm only saying honest stuff and keeping it real
	Wish it wasn‚Äôt true
	And feel you only care about getting your way not our way
	our way you consider my way 
	Not true‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not at all selfish type‚Ä¶. not when I start to care‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ you think my demands are what I want but they are what‚Äôs right for us‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ not me, you don‚Äôt see that and that‚Äôs what is most disappointing and my bigger fear now is this is how its gonna continue and thats to steal your word ‚Äúuneasy‚Äù part
	Giving you tomorrow I agree is a small sacrifice‚Ä¶. but the bigger picture is what is troublesome ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll never ever ever make you do something you don‚Äôt wanna do‚Ä¶I‚Äôm not a controlling individual, apparently just a lil bit wiser , honest, genuine and experience in the matters of the heart then my lady
	My stance  is from the heart and Love based, I feel your stance is from the mind and fear based. To break it down in layman terms for ya my lady!! Im 100% sure of my intentions don‚Äôt understand yours and your logic imho is flawed and don‚Äôt make sense to me‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. bottom line until the day I can‚Äôt walk the walk anymore my it is of utmost importance to honor my lady‚Äôs wishes.
	eliminate ‚Äúmy‚Äù
	Whether I agree or don‚Äôt agree
	You wanna know what really pissed me off? lol
	ehhhh maybe I‚Äôll tell you in person‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. better said tomorrow remind me to mention to  ya
Sherma:
	Prefer to hear it now if you don't mind 
Ish:
	nope
	What do you think about my other comments?
	Do they mean anything to you?
	Or you thinks I‚Äôm just someone rambling trying to get his way, that I‚Äôm playing some game or something
	Nothing to say?
Sherma:
	In a few 
Ish:
	k
Sherma:
	Saying our way implies that we both agree, clearly I don't.  
	You made some valid points 
Ish:
	then why not change your mind
	or atleast take away the no chance decree and let nature take its course
	if it doesn‚Äôt happen I‚Äôm fine if it does I‚Äôm fine
	Why be a hypocrite my lady‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. 
Sherma:
	Are you going to spend the entire day being stuck with the same argument 
Ish:
	nope
Sherma:
	Okay 
Ish:
	Entire day or date?
Sherma:
	Day
Ish:
	maybe‚Ä¶ lol
Sherma:
	Could you talk to me about something warm and fuzzy
Ish:
	All I want to do‚Ä¶. but your the one making confessions after 3 dates not me
Sherma:
	Okay 
	Next 
Ish:
	What you wanna talk about my lady
Sherma:
	Anything 
Ish:
	But what bothers me
Sherma:
	Other than that 
Ish:
	Exactly 
Sherma:
	I meant other than sat 
	What pisses you off 
Ish:
	What you want me to say I‚Äôm losing feelings for you‚Ä¶.. it hurts and it bothers me
	Over nonsense a formality.
Sherma:
	Question 
	??
Ish:
	I‚Äôll tell you tomorrow its a bit delicate and I wanna proceed with caution
Sherma:
	If their are more negative things about me, why are you still pursuing me ?
Ish:
	Im starting to ask myself that
	I wouldn‚Äôt say negative thats a strong word, I‚Äôd say disappointed 
	You‚Äôve hurt me, no big deal its a compliment to you.
	I wear my heart on its sleeve‚Ä¶.not your fault
	Should I say better I‚Äôm hurt not necessarily by you but my ego being hurt thinking I knew you better 
	Its a process no big deal I‚Äôve never been scared to be hurt fear doesn‚Äôt drive me in relationships I‚Äôm very much fearless
	Again, I haven‚Äôt been in many relationships but they‚Äôve been real.
	100%
	floor yours
	?
Sherma:
	You text tells a different story, painting me in a different light. From being a hypocrite to deceitful. Why do you want to be with someone like me ??? 
	Won't it be wiser for you to cut your losses before you go in hard and hurt more ?
Ish:
	My text point out your actions thats all.
	Are you a hypocrite? idk but its hypocritical to tell someone not to do something and then do the same thing to them
	Agreed?
	Is it deceitful to hid something about themselves to reveal after 10 dates, almost 4 in reality? idk
	What‚Äôs wise for me is to tell you my feelings and be honest 
	and respect your wishes even if I don‚Äôt agree‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ if you become a lost cause then I‚Äôll walk‚Ä¶. if it feels right to walk I will. I‚Äôm not really considering that point lo! Women get emotional and stuff I don‚Äôt ever take them literally especially ones with feelings for me, lol! 
	floors yours
	One last thing from everything I know and feel (things can change Im not omniscient) we should be doing it! It‚Äôs the right time (unless your on your period of course). Timing I feel is very important too soon or too late is just as important IMHO
	all you my lady!! Ive basically said all I plan on saying about this subject
Sherma:
	I'm no hypocrite to start with, I haven't told you what to do . What I've done is presenting you with options. 
Deceitful, I'm not. Why would I tell you something that's completely personal about myself when in fact we are seeing each other. There's no omg I'm so in love with him and I've kept this big secret and now it has created trust issue. 
Ish:
	Options? What options - respect your wishes or walk?
	How is it not hypocritical to say you want things to happen natural and then say it won‚Äôt happen PERIOD!
Sherma:
	Options: If you not happy then walk 
If the cons outweigh the pros then walk 
If I'm too much then walk 


	I'd I'm not worth it then walk 
	I'd = if
Ish:
	lol! your funny
	Typical woman‚Ä¶..
Sherma:
	Clearly I'm not giving you any reason to stay 
Ish:
	I was hoping you‚Äôd find me as the exception to the rule, not the prototype reason for the rule
	Please try and not put words into my mouth‚Ä¶. Clearly I never said‚Ä¶
	I don‚Äôt walk away from people I care about. You still interest me but your actions are suspect and I enjoy the fact (no matter how frustrating it might turn out) that we can discuss them
	That right now is the healthiest (positive) about us
	The unhealthiest is of course is I never get my way
	Will that ever change?
Sherma:
	Eventually 
	Totally agree healthy fighting 
Ish:
	Wow u finally agree with me on something
	I'll say this much you better be worth the wait or I will walk üòúüòú
	Waiting is 100% exactly what we are doing 
	ü§îü§îü§îü§îü§îü§îü§îü§î
	Fwiw when it comes to dates I'm like a dog!!!  1 = 7 so in my eyes tommorrow is our 28th date 
Sherma:
	I AM WORTH IT !!!  There's no sales pitch 
I'm the best you'll ever have 
	No ego involved 
Ish:
	Then forgiving you should be easy 
	Hearing that Only makes me want you more and deepens the pains I feel
	And the same could be said about me my lady!
	Do you think I might be your best ever?
Sherma:
	When we do it will be the best ever 
Ish:
	Lol! That's my girl 
	I give you tommorrow it's yours no
	No Problem
	I'll do my best to bring my best poker face and hide my disappointment  
	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qH4qyi1-Ys
Sherma:
	No poker face, just be smiling when ur with me 
	I like you smiling 
Ish:
	then give in to me
Sherma:
	Put on your best Poker face 
	It's all good 
Ish:

Sherma:

	It hurts 
Ish:
	Sums up my pain lol!
	Congrats!!
	I know priceless!
Sherma:

Ish:

	I feel its my job to make you feel sexy and irresistible and not knowing that I might‚Äôve made some insensitive remarks
Sherma:
	Hold up 
	Not your job to make me feel sexy 
Ish:
	It is‚Ä¶..no question
Sherma:
	Nope 
Ish:
	Yup
	The woman I‚Äôm with will feel like they are the sexiest most precious thing on earth

Ish:
	You mentioned some of your flaws last nite ‚Ä¶. some you might not feel 100% about so I just wanted to ask you about other parts of your body like your tooth

	Does that question make you feel uncomfortable ?
Sherma:
	Nope 
Ish:
	You answered wtf before
Sherma:
	It's fucking weird ass remark 
	But go for it 
Ish:
	Im weird
	But it will lead somewhere
Sherma:
	You're telling me this now 
Ish:
	You seemed surprised thats all if you know me soo well you should‚Äôve expected it
	I told you I‚Äôm not predictable‚Ä¶.. only when I get no love do I become predictable
Sherma:
	Next question please 
Ish:
	My approach to getting love will always vary
Sherma:
	That's why you seem predictable for the past week 
	Gotcha 
Ish:
	So do you have a nice ass?
Sherma:
	Fuck yeah 
Ish:
	Am I allowed to touch it tomorrow?
	one lil squeeze please
Sherma:
	Do you have an ass fetish ?
Ish:
	Im very gentle don‚Äôt even enjoy spanking women
Sherma:
	Urghh, damn 
Ish:
	I told you legs and behind are my two favorite features
	on a woman
Sherma:
	We're not twins cuz I do enjoy spanking 
	Glad you brought it up now instead of later 
	So disappointing 
Ish:
	The twins comments were said mainly to compliment your ego since in your pics they looked very healthy
	If you like something I‚Äôll do it np
Sherma:
	Totally kidding 
Ish:
	I honestly don‚Äôt believe you‚Äôll crave any spanking 
	Do I get to feel the goods tomorrow or not?
Sherma:
	I do like a little rough play 
	Hullo ??
	Goods ??
Ish:
	Ass
	Goods = your bottom
	Can i squeeze you butt 2more
	2moro

Ish:
	I‚Äôll be better then good my lady
	Back to my line of questioning ok? 
Sherma:
	It's you that getting side track 
	How long does it take to ask a question 
Ish:
	I enjoy side track if its fruitful
	Is  the issue with your breast permanent ? Or do  you need plastic surgery or anything
Sherma:
	No surgery required 
Ish:
	My first girlfriend had multiple breast reductions fwiw
Sherma:
	Implants were removed and my breast is not as tight and firm with the implants gone 
Ish:
	Can your nipples get hard?
Sherma:
	Omg, really 
Ish:
	What I‚Äôm silly I like to ask questions‚Ä¶..
Sherma:
	Yes Artie, all sensitivity is still there 
Ish:
	Do you enjoy having them touched? What is it that makes you uncomfortable most about them
Sherma:
	That it is not firm like it use too 
Ish:
	Whose Idea was it to get the implants?
Sherma:
	My husband 
	But I later came to love it 
Ish:
	It took my by surprise didn‚Äôt think you would get implants and it bothered me yesterday when you said the implants made you feel sexiest
	Don‚Äôt believe a woman should need or feel aesthetics to make her feel sexy‚Ä¶.. 
	And you don‚Äôt at all come across like that
	I would never ask a woman or she would ever feel she wasn‚Äôt good enough the way she was
	I will pay equal attention to her whole body‚Ä¶.
	Although I find a womans body very attractive‚Ä¶..the fact she trusts me with the job of pleasuring her is even more attractive for me. 
	Its why I never had any desire for threesomes and such
Sherma:
	The word "job" sounds like it's a task 
Ish:
	1 on 1 is all I ever need or wanted
	cmon I‚Äôm not cutting and pasting this are you ever happy with anything I say
Sherma:
	Another word I dislike when it relates to sexual relations 
Ish:
	We have no sexual relations those 2 words are non existent
Sherma:
	I'm telling you what I like and don't 
Ish:
	Cut me some slack
Sherma:
	Just saying 
Ish:
	Ruin the moment your good at that lost my thoughts
Sherma:
	Continue ...
Ish:
	Remember When I told you earlier about being pissed off
Sherma:
	Yea
Ish:
	It was because you said the thing that made you feel most sexy was fake and I think thats a problem with not only you but your lover IMO‚Ä¶.. not judging but it cause me to react a bit angrily
	Its not a big deal in the whole big picture overall just never something my women ever had to worry about feeling inadequate anywhere
	I make it a priority ‚Ä¶.. early in my life remember I mentioned about being with a lot of belly dancers or something like that
	In my early 20‚Äôs or so
Sherma:
	 Yea I do 
	Remember 
Ish:
	I spent a lot of times in strip clubs‚Ä¶. I was a stock broker and basically learned a lot about women main reason I never get jealous
	Dating strippers you learn not to get jealous trust me it was a learned behavior‚Ä¶.
	But I would see all these absolutely beautiful woman and all I‚Äôd ever hear after getting to know em and hang out with them was how much they wish they had nicer bodies or had her this or hers that‚Ä¶. It was very educational to see how the mind of a woman works
	Provided me great insight into woman
	Just saying and all‚Ä¶.. And I want you to know if you feel uncomfortable about anything physically with you Ill make it a mental note and will get you through it‚Ä¶
	And I truly feel most comfortable around a women when there naked‚Ä¶. 
	I don‚Äôt get star struck or stare , many times later in life woman have always commented about how they feel very comfortable around  me naked
	One of the first things my ex wife commented about me
	Even when we living together but apart she would never feel uncomfortable walking freely around me‚Ä¶ she would explode if  I get in her space or touch her but never uncomfortable
	And I don‚Äôt think you should or will feel uncomfortable around me naked one main reason why when you told me I pushed harder to get in your pants
	You will probably feel as comfortable around woman as me‚Ä¶ its the affect I have on most woman
	Just sharing facts with you my lady. honest facts‚Ä¶ floor is yours
	You didn‚Äôt fall asleep yet did you?
	?
Sherma:
	No still here 
Ish:
	Sorry about the book felt appropriate
	you considering cancelling tomorrow now?
Sherma:
	Still on
Ish:
	Cool
	Like my story?
Sherma:
	Interesting 
	Your views and insights 
Ish:
	Did it bother you? believe any of it?
	we still cool? no changes?
Sherma:
	Didn't bother me one bit and no reason to doubt you 
	Slightly thrown off that your wife still walks around nude in front of you 
	But it's cool 
	Gots no problem with anything 
Ish:
	Think it helps you feel more comfortable being without clothes in front of me?
Sherma:
	Ehh
	Nice story tho 
Ish:
	It‚Äôs worth a shot‚Ä¶. but all is true
	And I haven‚Äôt seen ex in quite some time in that situation 
	You figured out a time yet we can meet
Sherma:
	Nope
	I'm good with having an eggplant parm and beer 
	Just a simple chic 
	Not hard to please 
Ish:
	And to rewind the tape on us‚Ä¶. it‚Äôs another reason why I didn‚Äôt get scared off or judge you when you claimed to be an escort and all
	You are anything but simple imo
	You have fought me every inch of the way 
	No spotted pig? Or do they serve eggplant
Sherma:
	Do you need reservations ?
Ish:
	Nope
Sherma:
	Okay 
Ish:
	Try some Gnudi?
Sherma:
	Awesome 
Ish:
	Its considered a gastropub so they sell beer
	You pay for dinner and I‚Äôll pay for the room or vice versa my sweet perfect breasted irresistible kind and understanding did I say sexy lady???
Sherma:
	Room??
Ish:
	I‚Äôll always have my pole in the water my lady
	Never give up!!! LOL
Sherma:

Ish:
	It was a joke..
	Room as in hotel room 
	Damn your slow
Sherma:
	I know smarty pants 
Ish:
	I know your tired
	Guess you didn‚Äôt appreciate my attempt at humor oh well!
Sherma:
	 Fail 
Ish:
	In more ways then one
Sherma:
	You're a fast learner 
Ish:
	Utter disaster
Sherma:
	Took how many bricks ??
Ish:
	There are not enough bricks in this universe to stop me unfortunately
	You will not even recognize me after the bedding ceremony lol!
Sherma:
	Just one cute, sexy, irresistible female to slow you down 
Ish:
	true dat

Sherma:
	Yup
Ish:

Sherma:
	Nope

Ish:
	Im done dreaming over you
	Only have nightmares these days
Sherma:
	No more wet dreams, I'm devastated 
Ish:
	Love kicking a man when he‚Äôs down don‚Äôt you
	Build me up then knock me down
Sherma:
	Nope, when he's down I like that 
	Just flew over your head 
Ish:
	Please no way
Sherma:
	üõ©
	Lol 
Ish:
	I‚Äôll believe it when I see it
	Otherwise it just bull!!
	üêÉ
Sherma:
	üí©
Ish:
	Im glad were finally getting along tonite
Sherma:
	Reminds me of you in tinder 
Ish:
	In what way?
Sherma:
	Laid back, no pressure and good come back 
	You swung well 
Ish:
	if you say so! I‚Äôm done arguing with you.
	Blue balls have an affect on a man even me my lady
	üîµ
	üîµ
	You like my cute lil testicles?
Sherma:
	Is that from playing with yourself 
	Smh 
Ish:
	I don‚Äôt play and tell 
Sherma:
	From the looks of the balls you don't have to say anymore 
Ish:
	Like you even care anyway
	Agreed!
Sherma:
	Not going there my lord 
	Loving this moment 
	I'm in a good place and so are you 
Ish:
	Thats our only problem ‚Äú you don‚Äôt go there‚Äù
	I‚Äôm good
Sherma:
	Glad to know 
	When was the last time you had some ??
Ish:
	I‚Äôm not talking about this‚Ä¶.
Sherma:
	Cuz it seems like you need to destress, just saying 
Ish:
	I‚Äôm not desperate for sex‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ desperate for you 100%
	Its not just sex! A man of my caliber feels unappreciated when he don‚Äôt get paid for his services‚Ä¶. 
	But overall after how this week started I‚Äôm happy with the outcome and feel much better regardless about you and us
	Before the 10th decree you could do no wrong in my eyes‚Ä¶.. although the shine might‚Äôve faded its still bright in my eyes my lady
	I got a lot off my chest today with you tried to make you understand my feelings and all I‚Äôm almost feel at peace
Sherma:
	I'm all diamond, not cubic ziconia .. Shine is always there 
Ish:
	not after 10th decree and last few days‚Ä¶.. almost regressed to coal
Sherma:
	I'm a bit of a challenge 
	Tiny tiny bit 
Ish:
	I‚Äôm not going there‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ its still a sore subject with me
	Ive more then past any challenges 
	Lets not start this‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think you understand what this has done to me
	I am very simple guy don‚Äôt usually ask for things 
	This is not in my character to get like this over time you will agree with my side
	I‚Äôm doing my best my lady
Sherma:
	A little brown girl did this to you ?? 
Ish:
	Look in the mirror and honestly can you say the same?
	You enjoy this‚Ä¶ and yes a 200lb escort did this to me
Sherma:
	Fuck 
	She must really be worth it 
Ish:
	Time will tell. I surely hope so
	üôè
Sherma:
	Ur already in deep, can't get out 
	Even if you try 
	Slippery slope and your back in 
Ish:
	At this point ill do anything to get back in
	jk i still have my dignity intact
Sherma:
	You threw that out the window the moment you kissed her 
	You became softer and more gentle 
Ish:
	You are something else‚Ä¶. If there was an interest meter or turned on meter and we both got tested I‚Äôd bet a lot your higher on the meter then me
	If I didn‚Äôt think it was mutual I‚Äôd wouldn‚Äôt bother
	You talk about my ego ‚Ä¶.. cmon!!!
Sherma:
	I'm trailing behind 
Ish:
	not anymore
	You‚Äôve stomped my ego
Sherma:
	Stop playing, you got this under wraps 
Ish:
	Sure don‚Äôt feel like it
	Not feeling too confident
Sherma:
	Nahhh, was talking bout your ego 
Ish:
	My ego is bruised 
	Im not gonna lie facts are facts
Sherma:
	Much appreciate 
	5'2 115-117 did some damage ... 
	I gained 2 lbs 
Ish:
	Yes
Sherma:
	Aawh 
Ish:
	I wasn‚Äôt lying when I said i was hurt 
	I don‚Äôt believe you did it purposely but it is what it is
	Its eustress actually that caused it 
	And maybe a lil bit old wounds creeping up did a lot of thinking about all my old flames
	Your were not doubt the main culprit
	Happier?
Sherma:
	Thoughts of old flames and I ignite it ??
Ish:
	You douse flames with water please
Sherma:
	Do I dare ask, how so ?
Ish:
	Flames are great‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. you putting em out is what hurts
	How so? By not reciprocating 
	This isn‚Äôt rocket science
Sherma:
	Didn't want you burning up my lord 
	Had your best interest at heart 
Ish:
	Of course
	Mrs cold hands
	Hey I put a lot on myself to warm you up thats what was really killing me until you made your confession actually eased my pain a bit
	But when you started making the confession and said you‚Äôd think about it I was sooo sure you were gonna do it‚Ä¶.. and then when I woke up this morning and you declined again it was very hard to take brought pain of the week all back and made me feel hopeless or powerless
	But now after exhausting all strategies to close the deal I‚Äôm getting over it almost back to normal
	And feel better now then I did earlier in week
	about 70% hope to be like 80-85% by 2pm
	Until your clothes come off you‚Äôll never see more then 80-85
Sherma:
	Psssh 
	You just have to put your tongue in my mouth and you're there at 100%
Ish:
	If you say so my lady I‚Äôm hoping you believe that
Sherma:
	You were weak after kissing me 
Ish:
	I like kissing you
	Not as weak as you please - I‚Äôm the one who reminded you of the time
Sherma:
	You're the one who needed a min before standing up 
Ish:
	I promise tho there is another gear or two for me
Sherma:
	I totally won this round 
Ish:
	Like I said you haven‚Äôt seen anything yet‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.
Sherma:
	You on automatic and I do manual 
Ish:
	What round you talking about?
	Ive admitted you‚Äôve won!
	But you didn‚Äôt win any makeup session
	I taught you how to kiss please
	makeup= makeout
	I owned you in that category
Sherma:
	If you say so 
Ish:
	Again I don‚Äôt think of it as a competition , I like kissing you
Sherma:
	You just have to say "Sherma, you do crazy shit to my mind and body" and  so nonfunctional without you 
Ish:
	You were without question inspiring to me and its great what your saying
Sherma:
	When I kiss your lips I feel myself burning up 
Ish:
	But theres more work to be done‚Ä¶.. Im at like not even 2nd base and it pisses me off
	I feel it too , burning up a bit as well
	hurts you won‚Äôt go further but now I understand more don‚Äôt feel as bad
Sherma:
	Was totally referring to you on the burning up bit with me 
	Good to see that you're with it 
	And admitted to
Ish:
	Of course you feel nothing body temperature stays the same
	I have no game and thats why you won‚Äôt sleep with me
	I‚Äôll try to do better my lady
	Appreciate you accepting me for all my shortcomings
	Very kind and generous
	Thanks for being so patient with me
Sherma:
	I appreciate you, that's  it 
Ish:
	Is that good or bad?
Sherma:
	It's all good 
Ish:
	Not good enough?
Sherma:
	Good enough 
Ish:
	Thx
Sherma:
	Anytime 
Ish:
	I told you my egos bruised
Sherma:
	Multiple times 
	If your heart was bruised then I would have empathize 
	Ego ?? Ehh, not so much 
Ish:
	If I admit my heart was bruised would you put out?
Sherma:
	Then I would recommend a cardiologist 
	Would hug you tho and let you know that, you're gonna be okay
Ish:
	Then I don‚Äôt  want or need you to empathize my lady
	My ego isn‚Äôt that bruised
Sherma:
	Truth comes out 
	Yaay 
Ish:
	I‚Äôll survive and soon reverse the tables on you
Sherma:
	Ooh,  play nice now 
Ish:
	I‚Äôll give you the first time‚Ä¶.. afterwards you‚Äôll be the one begging
	Mark this post!! 
Sherma:
	Begging for what ?? 
Ish:
	What else is there ‚Ä¶. ‚ÄúL‚Äù
	Payback is a bitch
Sherma:
	The thing is, I just have to look up at you with my brown eyes and seduce you 
Ish:
	Before the 10th decree yes without question , now I know your chickenshit I won‚Äôt fall for it
	I do enjoy kissing you very much my lady!
	Some things you can‚Äôt fake
	There is intention behind when I kiss you an intention you are not able to handle apparently
	Hopefully one day you will!
	And you have great bedroom eyes!
	But whats the point of bedroom eyes without the bedroom
	All this irony is why my ego went down the toilet this week
	And I‚Äôm not gonna lie even if you said no sex or whatever doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt wish I was next to you right now
	I‚Äôm have no problem sleeping next to a woman without doing it!
	If you really want to see who crumbles first that I‚Äôd consider a real challenge
	Then we will see who overheats from kissing
Sherma:
	I'm up for the challenge 
Ish:
	Better be prepared to get very little sleep my lady
Sherma:
	I could lay next to you 
	And wake up with my chastity belt still intact 
	Better yet the belt won't even be worn 
	Let's see who crumbles 
Ish:
	After this last week I‚Äôll never doubt your stubbornness
	I hope one day though we can do that
	I wouldn‚Äôt mind doing it everyday, you are someone I feel I could be around all the time
	Thats the main reason I put up with your low sex drive
Sherma:
	Doesn't phase me when you say that 
	You're addicted to me 
	That's the only reason you put up with me 
	I'm your drug of choice 
Ish:
	Im not gonna argue with it‚Ä¶.. no shame in admitting it right?
Sherma:
	None what so ever 
	Look at you fessing up 
	Great progress 
Ish:
	My hope one day is maybe it‚Äôll be mutual
Sherma:
	Dreams do come true 
Ish:
	Not mine yet
	Only nightmares
Sherma:
	Ruin the moment 
Ish:
	I‚Äôm trying to be like you  my lady and twin
Sherma:
	Your nightmare is that you might loose me and you feel powerless 
Ish:
	My nightmare is us getting along and me not getting what I want
	Haven‚Äôt you figured that out yet?
Sherma:
	Not it 
Ish:
	It‚Äôs true
Sherma:
	Nope 
	Partial truth, maybe 
Ish:
	We will not have a healthy relationship until we do it
Sherma:
	Your nightmare is that you are catching feeling for this girl and you don't know how to stop yourself 
	And you shift the blame to not getting what you want.. Your loins are innocent, it is your heart that's affected 
Ish:
	So wrong my lady nice try don‚Äôt know me as we‚Äôll as you think
	What you call my nightmare is my dream
	I want to feel for you where I won‚Äôt want to stop
	Its called falling in Love
	I want to fall in love
	I will not take you seriously and put you in elite status with my other loves until you trust me enough to give yourself to me
	Until then your just a pretender
	Chicken shit scared to get hurt 
	I will never fall in love with a woman I don‚Äôt sleep with 
Sherma:
	A pretended who obviously has invaded you head and body 
Ish:
	Ive been in love before know it all too well maybe one day I‚Äôll show you a moment or two of it
	Maybe longer‚Ä¶.. but again you have really no idea who  your dealing with
Sherma:
	That exterior that you're showing off, it's just a shell 
Ish:
	Its not all talk
	You will find out ‚Äúeventually‚Äù
Sherma:
	I am capable of getting under your skin 
	And that's just not talk 
Ish:
	You are but my skin gets thick real quick
	I don‚Äôt want it to with you i‚Äôll be truthful
	But it started this week 
Sherma:
	Yeah, that's your adrenaline when I'm with you 
Ish:
	You have a lot of good qualities about you
	But your blowing it
	I have faith in you and all‚Ä¶. but we could‚Äôve had some really awesome moments if you let me take control of this and stop fighting me
	you have no idea
	When one is in control they are incapable of love
	Ive seen if first hand‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. maybe one day I‚Äôll explain it to you if now show you first
	You think I told a good story about the strip clubs maybe one day I‚Äôll tell you some stories about me and me ex‚Äôs 
Sherma:
	Don't need to know about your ex 
Ish:
	After we do if first of course
	ex ‚Äòs
	All my ex‚Äôs and a few others
	I have to hear about your ex‚Äôs and how they deliver lol
Sherma:
	It was one sentence 
Ish:
	I don‚Äôt wanna tell you anything rather show you
	One sentence that hurt
	one sentence I‚Äôve never wrote or said
	But you rather row away from me
	You think Im just good with words, its true but expressing feelings and real pure emotion I‚Äôm even better at
	hopefully you‚Äôll see me truly happy one day‚Ä¶. now thats a sight but you wanna stay on the ground it appears where I wanna lift off lol
	Keep me on the ground bruising me lol
	Clip my wings
Sherma:
	Damn that ego rebounded really fast 
Ish:
	Very funny
	All true no ego 
	I don‚Äôt have an ego
Sherma:
	So you tell lies about a bruise ego , hoping to gain sympathy 
	Smh 
Ish:
	You bruised my heart not my ego ok?
	Happier?
Sherma:
	Just the truth makes me happy 
Ish:
	Gold don‚Äôt stay bruised for long though
Sherma:
	Don't like gold 
Ish:
	You can‚Äôt handle the truth‚Ä¶.. thats why you run from me
Sherma:
	I so prefer platinum 
Ish:
	Nothing wrong with a gold heart
Sherma:
	No bueno 
Ish:
	I wouldn‚Äôt exchange it for anything. I‚Äôm happy being me
Sherma:
	Won't ask you to change who you are 
Ish:
	Then make love to me already?
Sherma:
	How did we go from acceptance to making love ?
Ish:

	File Transfer: Current Location.loc.vcf

Sherma:
	K bye
	Hey 
Ish:
	Hi!
Sherma:
	Hi
	Been a crazy day 
Ish:
	I can imagine! Sorry to hear hope your friend is ok. 
Sherma:
	She's okay, her boyfriend was arrested 
	Her daughters are my god children 
Ish:
	Did she call the police or the neighbors?
Sherma:
	She did 
	I'm staying over tonight 
	Way you did today ?
Ish:
	I just woke up a few mins, took a nap most of the day. Nice your there for her, good friend. Figuring the bf isn‚Äôt the daughters father
Sherma:
	Nope, father left her for another woman
Ish:
	Must‚Äôve been a lil tough for the kids feel bad‚Ä¶ Do you wanna still talk about it or rather me talk about other things to get your mind off it
Sherma:
	Can't really talk very long, she's napping and I'm with the girls 
	Her youngest is 18 months old 
Ish:
	In case of emergency would you be able to feed her?
Sherma:
	She drinks from a bottle and eat solid food 
	Smart ass 
Ish:
	Just checking on my twins my lady
	My new two favorite things
Sherma:
	What's the other ?
Ish:
	twins = breasts = 2
	Got it?
Sherma:
	A pair is not considered 2 things 
	It's ( a =1 )
Ish:
	Sounds like my woman might be a lil frustrated she can‚Äôt spoon with me, she‚Äôs back to her petty self I see üòò
	my woman = my lady
	It‚Äôs ok its not a sprint don‚Äôt forget that
Sherma:
	Did you refer to me as your woman?
Ish:
	I will if you refer to me as your man, otherwise it‚Äôs like I corrected a typo
Sherma:
	Hmm I see 
Ish:
	What do you see? Please enlighten me
Sherma:
	I see ownership is setting in 
Ish:
	Lol!
	Definitely! Thats my MO
	You feel suffocated be me Sherma? 
	be = by
Sherma:
	Nope 
Ish:
	So  the comment (typo) is a good thing or bad thing? Or you just busting my chops like usual
Sherma:
	I've been for a long time someone wife, someone daughter, someone mother. I forgot who I was in the process 
Ish:
	Thats not my fault‚Ä¶.. remember that and you sure seem to know yourself now so don‚Äôt take a typo or term of endearment the wrong way
Sherma:
	I know it's not you fault :(
	Girls grow up with having their fathers name, then their husbands name. They belong to someone Thor whole life and never really get to be their own person 
	Thor= their
Ish:
	If thats what you think and feel sorry you see it like that.  What‚Äôs in a name? Most woman‚Äôs greatest moments in their life is when they get married? Always found that strange‚Ä¶. But I‚Äôll tell you what you get me to get married again I‚Äôll take you name , deal?
Sherma:
	üôÑ
	I'm not like other women 
	Marriage wasn't the highlight of my life but the birth of my children 
Ish:
	I assure your I‚Äôd change that 100% if you were ever lucky enough
	And you don‚Äôt want children anymore remember that
Sherma:
	I don't 
	That's the reason I'm not the right person for you 
	You need to have a little girl, she would make all the difference in your life 
Ish:
	Don‚Äôt want a girl no thx
	Don‚Äôt really need kids accepted the fact I wouldn‚Äôt have any while ago. Got 1 perfect not greedy
	perfect son*
	What reason your not right for me? Whats a matter Sherma disappointed a bit Awwwww, sorry we will see each other soon.  Don‚Äôt worry
Sherma:
	I'm only looking out for you my lord. The blessing of a girl child is like a gift from God 
	My dad meant the world to me 
Ish:
	Sure your right. I know how much you cared for your Dad‚Ä¶. My Son adores me though and I feel blessed being a father regardless‚Ä¶. and Son‚Äôs love their mothers and my family tree Hummler‚Äôs make boys, something to consider my lady , üòç
	I go with mother nature you should try it with me sometime‚Ä¶.. row downhill not uphill 
Sherma:
	I'll take it into consideration 
Ish:
	If those hat means what I think it doesüôè.
	I hope that means what  think it doesüôè
	You get the point!
Sherma:
	Yea I do 
Ish:
	It‚Äôs the perfect point mark this post!
Sherma:
	That's your thing, won't dare take it away from you 
	Mark the post 
Ish:
	You‚Äôve cut it off this last week, liar
	Ive been talking with a high pitch voice all week
Sherma:
	I'm sure it was tuck away, not cut off 
Ish:
	I guess we‚Äôll find out that soon my lady
Sherma:
	Hold on 
	Ordered pizza, let me sort it out for them 
Ish:
	k
Sherma:
	Ttyl 
	Sleeping ?
Ish:
	Nope
	Slept most of day lol
Sherma:
	Who does that ?
Ish:
	Someone sick that's who
Sherma:
	You're sick ?
	Didn't know 
	Sorry 
Ish:
	Np you going thru enough plate is full 
Sherma:
	I'm vege, my plate is never filled 
Ish:
	I still would've shown up to spoon I'm not dead
Sherma:
	You never mention that you were sick 
Ish:
	You still promised to make it up to me and I'm gonna hold you to that
	Didn't feel it necessary to tell you just started feeling bad when I woke up this morning
	It got worse throughout the day 
Sherma:
	It's a good thing I didn't lay down with you 
	I'm glad you rested 
	It helps 
Ish:
	Doesn't get you off hook for today you promised to make it up to me correct? Is your word still good?
Sherma:
	Honestly comes from honor 
	I'm honest 
Ish:
	So you gonna make it up to me multiple times correct?
Sherma:
	Huh??
	Spoon you, yes 
Ish:
	‚úàÔ∏è
Sherma:
	You need to get better tho 
Ish:
	Ofcourse I'll be fine
	what merit system we on my lady # of dates still or what?
	I need a status report please or I'm never gonna heal
Sherma:
	You gonna get your spoon date 
Ish:
	That's great ...No restrictions? 
Sherma:
	If I'm not comfortable I will stop you 
	Limited restrictions 
Ish:
	Whatever feels natural correct? Nothing is guaranteed 
	Let nature finally determine the date fair enough?
Sherma:
	Let me determine the date 
Ish:
	But you aren't ruling anything out correct?
	Menu will write itself no pressure 
Sherma:
	We will see 
Ish:
	All I ever asked is for things not to be predetermined 
	Otherwise the truth will never be known 
Sherma:
	What truth ?
Ish:
	Idk that's the best part of it 
	The truth will be known the next day ...... The day after
	Can you live with living In The moment and not worrying what happens
	That's how most people in this world date
	They don't go out with preconceived expectations or outcomes 
	Only this or only that or just this or just that
	It's insane !!!
	I know it's driving me crazy 
Sherma:
	You get yourself worked up for no reason at all 
	Focus on getting better 
Ish:
	You give me the green light I'll instantly feel better so my focus is right where it needs to be
Sherma:
	Get better 
Ish:
	See I knew I shouldn't have told you I wasn't feeling well
	I was gonna say something when you were beating me up about my woman comment 
	And I had the will to swallow my tongue guess I'm starting to feel better already my lady 
	Love heals all wounds I suppose you have that effect my lady
Sherma:
	So is antibiotics 
Ish:
	My antibodies are fine I'll be good (my usual 80% for our dates) by the time you get the time to see me again
	I'll be 100% if you stop with all your rules and restrictions 
	Your are unique in that way I must say
	Never been out with a woman so paranoid before lol it was cute in the beginning but now we're technically on our 6th scheduled date ( you pulled out of 2 now) cmon!!! 
Sherma:
	Pulling out is good , no ?
Ish:
	Lol! Not for me if I want a daughter 
	Sherma cute very cute! You are a good talker I'll say that my lady
Sherma:
	Tenks
	Do you ever fantasize about me ??
Ish:
	YW !! Is the talking over for our next date? Instead of 0 expectations can we go to 0 restrictions now?
Sherma:
	Wanna know what's going on your head 
Ish:
	I have .... You've said some very sexy stuff to me whether it was intended or not it was hot.  Like I said your a good talker
	Will the fantasy ever become real? 
	I know you've fantasized about me
Sherma:
	Please 
	I dont
Ish:
	I make you hot! That's why you need these rules cuz your scared you'll lose control
Sherma:
	All in your head 
Ish:
	You've send my sexy pics what you expect me to say or do 
	Then why would you say sex with us would be amazing if you haven't thought or imagined it before ?
	Best ever was your last adjective if I remember correctly
	Should I copy and paste the post 
Sherma:
	I was exhausted probably wasn't thinking straight 
Ish:
	So predictable boring !! 
	Like I said you sure can talk a good game 
	Anyone ever tell you that you think too much
Sherma:
	That's a good thing 
Ish:
	Funny all this thinking you do yet when I make my Points that always push your buttons you always wind up seeing my logic as making sense and even went so far as to say you love it
	Should I cut and paste that post my lady?
	ü§î
Sherma:
	Nope 
Ish:
	So what's our status I said on Friday I'd give you tommorow.... Tommorrow is now over 
Sherma:
	Haven't had much time to think about anything today 
Ish:
	Haven't you done enough thinking 
	Ever answer what feels right 
	 Can't we be normal Instead of 0 expectations can we go to 0 restrictions now?
	What happens happens 
	Is that so difficult for you???
Sherma:
	You get what you ask for and what was promised if we had seen each other today 
Ish:
	Seriously?
	Do you mean that? What happened to soon..... And you need time 
	Your getting another week does anything I do over the next week matter??
Sherma:
	Could we switch it up a bit and talk bout something else 
	That's all we've been talking about all week long 
Ish:
	It's important 
	I feel betrayed by the whole week understanding now if nothing changes 
	We spoke and chatted until 1 in morning yesterday had a great day planned I was happier shit happens I understand didn't complain supported you and am there for you now does that count for anything? 
	Guess not its right back to next week will be what this weeks test was all about? Seriously ?
	And you need to think about what exactly?
	See this is not how things between two people care about should be... We shouldn't have to argue logically what happens each fucken date! Let it happen that's all I ask .... No restrictions 
	And I feel like the weeks keep going by and same old Sherma every time wtf
	You apparently know it all and have to control and micro manage every detail or otherwise I wouldn't argue with u
Sherma:
	I'm not the one arguing, it's you. Do you know one of the things that I have zero tolerance for, it's when you do something that's seemed nice and throws it back at me
Ish:
	I hate that too 
Sherma:
	That's a turn off for me 
Ish:
	I don't feel appreciated felt appropriate if you reciprocate I wouldn't have to
Sherma:
	I see it as being petty minded 
	There's never a reason for it , ever 
Ish:
	I've asked you a few times already for a normal date no restrictions no guarantees and you don't seem to care
	So I feel you don't see the big picture 
	I think this is common sense 
	Sorry throwing something I ones face doesn't not undo the kind act don't be spiteful 
	It's not nice and guy should ask yourself why I feel the need to 
	Guy = you
Sherma:
	Then don't do anything nice if you gonna throw it back at ones face 
	I will never do something like that 
	And I get that everyone is not me 
	But it doesn't sit well with me 
	You do things becuz you wanna do it 
	That's it 
Ish:
	I agree
Sherma:
	Then you're being a hypocrite 
Ish:
	I'm not arguing with you about !
	How am I being a hypocrite you are being one by calling me that
	I'm sick I'm not feeling my best and feel unappreciated by you! Something you have never felt by me
	And you continue to keep us in neutral apparently and it's frustrating 
	You flirt and ask me questions about fantasizing about you one minute and then the next minute pour cold water on me it hurts 
	Where we going? That's what I like to know I feel closer every week or day to you but it want it to lead somewhere 
	It hurts i wasn't able to see you today or the thought I could be spooning with you right now really sucks 
	But what's even worse is waiting to next week without any progress 
	Understand?
Sherma:
	Let me reiterate what I was saying : If you ever have to remind someone of something you e done for them, it's best not to do it 
	If I didn't appreciate you I won't be on the phone with you now 
	Where this leads to, I am clueless 
	You make it seem like I come on to you and then make fun of it 
Ish:
	So The person who feels the need to make rules and restrictions and thinks all the time is clueless that's great!
	That's how it feels .... Feels I'm being teased
	You said you got on tinder for conversation only
	Is that what I am? Is that why your chatting with me ? Lonely woman part delusional who likes to talk
	Needs to feel desired to feel good about herself 
	Wants 10 dates of conversation from me til she pushes me away
Sherma:
	Okay that's enough 
	If you're looking for a reason to walk away, you don't hAve to be mean 
	I don't need you or anyone else 
Ish:
	Is that why you reject me to prove that to yourself?
Sherma:
	I was fine before you came into my Luce and will be fine after 
Ish:
	I believe you so your feelings for me as clueless 
	As = are
	You honestly feel to have a normal date with no restrictions is too much to ask?
	I dislike indecision it's why I answer right away it's usually deceitful
	Why don't you trust me enough?
Sherma:
	Being alone and being lonely are two completely separate things 
	Want to clarify that 
Ish:
	I know 
Sherma:
	I had a life before you 
Ish:
	That's the past please try and focus on us if you can thx
Sherma:
	Don't make assumptions about me 
Ish:
	If you need to think about what your feelings are about me and what our status then something is wrong
	And that's why I felt need to make a case ......
	I ask you simple questions and you duck em a few times 
	The lawyer side of me comes out!!! I'm tired of that side just let me be me make me happier 
	Why you gotta think about giving me what I want ? 
	Just say Yes! 
	Trust me and say yes! 
Sherma:
	You're so use to getting things your way and if anyone defies that you can't handle it 
	It turns into an argument 
Ish:
	Who
Making an assumption now?
	Sorry I don't talk about my last few years and act like a victim and focus on positives
	It's an argument cuz you feel the need to give me something when I least expect it
	Those are your words 
	When have I ever acted
Controlling or its my way or the highway
	We spend a lot of time together it might be just texts but it means something to me 
	I don't understand restrictions !!! 
	This relationship is proof I never get what I want
	Not only do I not get what I want I have to make an argument like Johnny Cochran (famous lawyer) just to get a date without restrictions .... Who does this ?
	Am I just cursed 
	I put my whole soul into you and your clueless smh
Sherma:
	It's not your soul that you want to put into me and because it's not happening as fast as you would like it makes you crazy. Hence the reason you said some unkind things 
	Let's call a spade a spade 
Ish:
	Opportunity is all I ask ! You already said I can 
	The longer it takes for "the best ever" the more frustrating it become ls
	Again it's not about sex why don't u understand that
Sherma:
	You don't catch flies with salt, remember that 
Ish:
	More bees with honey 
	I know I know 
	I'm all out of honey got me blue balls 
	And another wasted week 
	And a clueless lady 
	Your words not mine
Sherma:
	So end it and stop wasting your time 
Ish:
	I don't want another wasted week , I don't want blue balls and I don't want a clueless lady of those 3 blue balls is the least priority
	I want a healthy relationship we sure talk enough 
	What do you want ? Need more time to think?
	Your gonna end it please I'm never gonna get what I want 
	You still see me as a man not Artie IMHO 
Sherma:
	I want you to do what's best for you The next relationship you have hopefully you won't be as frustrating 
Ish:
	If you saw Artie you would wanna make him happy it'd be a no brained you feel Artie but only care to see a man! 
	What's best for me it to be right next to you 
	No restrictions no bullshit no arguing 
	No fucken thinking 
	What's wrong with that?
	Is it so hard for you to be in the moment with me! It's been a month we know eachother
Sherma:
	Correct, a month not months 
Ish:
	If your undecided and don‚Äôt want to be with me by now‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..what more can I honestly do
	A month in the information age with texting and all is a long time please
	Why should it be months if its all about you?
	It can almost be said that we‚Äôve been like living with each other last month
	Thats how much we talk. and it kills me you don‚Äôt want me or are clueless
	its borderline heartless all thoughts
	You definitely aren‚Äôt heatless for our dates
	it‚Äôs all there‚Ä¶.. but you gotta put all these barriers and restrictions on me 
	Two 40 year old adults playing with high school rules is cute for a while 
	Cmon sherma compromise with me‚Ä¶. is it make you feel less to give in to me for some reason?
	I feel like it sometimes that you feel if you give me what I want it‚Äôs almost a competition, I‚Äôm not making unreasonable demands and I am a sweetheart 
	Really am, and I like you a lot and I try to be completely honest with you
	Why don‚Äôt you reciprocate ?
	I don‚Äôt do it for ya? I know thats not true‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.we have all those boxes checked my lady
	Best ever? What else is there to say?
	How would any man in their right mind walk away from that!
	You only have 1 flaw , 1 thing your lacking‚Ä¶. and that‚Äôs me!
	Don‚Äôt you wanna be perfect?
	I have the perfect weapon!
Sherma:
	No such thing as perfect 
Ish:
	Take me up on my offer and say that after then I‚Äôll believe it
	It‚Äôs perfect!
	If not then we can go on a 10 date plan cuz i‚Äôll need time 
	Deal?
	Sorry if i was lil rough on you with my comments but I‚Äôm sick I‚Äôm depressed I didn‚Äôt get to spend time with my lady and its honestly wearing on me‚Ä¶.. what you‚Ä¶. all of you ‚Ä¶.. and i wh
	what you = want you ‚Ä¶. all of you and I want even more for you to want me the same way‚Ä¶. thats what hurts the most is that apparently you don‚Äôt
	You can‚Äôt wait for surprises and have no patience there but have all the patience in the world with me even knowing it hurts me‚Ä¶. just kills me
	Had two boyfriends recently 1 your best friend another one in another state‚Ä¶. I want to feel like I‚Äôm your guy ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. Some security
	I worry the reason you think so much is about them not me‚Ä¶.
	You still there?
Sherma:
	Yes
Ish:
	floors yours
	You tired? nothing to say?
Sherma:
	I'm tired , you've worn me out 
Ish:
	Get used to it‚Ä¶. when we start doing it , I promise it‚Äôll feel much better
	You going give me some vote of confidence of some sort?
	Or you upset with me?
Sherma:
	Worn out to the point of saying that you could have your way with me and then you could walk away if you choose 
Ish:
	Please do‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ that would be great gave me goosebumps
	I will not walk away
	Care too much
	I promise!!!
Sherma:
	I can't love anyone , I can't promise that I will 
	It's how I feel 
Ish:
	Love is sure in your eyes on out dates lol
Sherma:
	You shouldn't have to settle for less 
	Don't settle for me 
Ish:
	I won‚Äôt settle for less‚Ä¶. and a bunch of talk will not determine my actions
	Actions determine actions
	So you gonna let me hit it finally?
Sherma:
	Yes
Ish:
	OMG!!!!!!!!!
	You mean it???
Sherma:
	Yes
Ish:
	ON valentines day?
	This weekend is valentines day
	Next weekend
Sherma:
	I hate valentines 
Ish:
	You also said  you hate the word hate
Sherma:
	Shut up 
Ish:
	Your words not mine
Sherma:
	I despise it
Ish:
	So when then?
Sherma:
	Either Friday or Saturday 
	If I could get you to stop talking it would sooner than later 
Ish:
	Ok‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. you will not be disappointed‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. Thank you ! I hope you don‚Äôt change your mind
	Wait a sec ‚Ä¶. stop talking and its sooner‚Ä¶ lol ! 
	Mrs 10 dates is now rushing it‚Ä¶ you are da best!!!!
	No more talking I love it!!!!!
	Maybe we are twins‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ finally on the same page
	Is this Sherma?
Sherma:
	I do not want a commitment or talks of it 
Ish:
	I don‚Äôt understand what you mean? Commitment to sex or commitment to exclusive relationship?
Sherma:
	Exclusive 
	I'm giving you what every man wants 
Ish:
	Your not saying this is a one night stand or are you?
Sherma:
	Do you still want me ?
Ish:
	Many times over
	Your not saying this is a one night stand or are you?
Sherma:
	No I'm not 
Ish:
	Unless i don‚Äôt deliver well correct?
Sherma:
	Doesn't matter to me 
	Whether it's the best performance or not . When I'm with you it's all about you 
Ish:
	Are you agreeing to this cuz I wore you out or you really want to?
Sherma:
	You've been pushing for this all week long , no ?
	Why question it when it's about to happen 
Ish:
	I have but I want you to agree with me not give in to me?
	There is a difference
Sherma:
	Do you want me ?
Ish:
	You know the answer to that
Sherma:
	Yes or no ?
Ish:
	YES
	Do you want me?
Sherma:
	Okay then we do it 
Ish:
	Yes or no?
Sherma:
	Yes
Ish:
	Why to shut me up or you feel its time?
Sherma:
	Because I dont have the energy to fight with you no more 
Ish:
	Now I feel guilty
	I was pushing more or less for no restrictions for things to happen natural no guarantees
Sherma:
	I gave my word,can't take it back 
Ish:
	I allow you ‚Ä¶. want you at 100% ‚Ä¶. no regrets otherwise thats just as bad for us
	You shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated‚Ä¶. its not my style its a kind gesture but it‚Äôll hurt just as much for me
	If it doesn‚Äôt feel right for you don‚Äôt have to make a promise
	Ok?
	I don‚Äôt want your pity
	Awake?
Sherma:
	Yea
Ish:

	Any regrets? Sorry if I was too hard on you i mean that

Sherma:
	
Made a promise to myself that revisiting the past is futile 
Ish:

Sherma:
	So whatever was said last night is long gone

Sherma:
	This would be different 
Ish:
	True dat
	Best date of ur life
Sherma:
	Asking or telling ?
Ish:
	This date will be best of your like I'm telling you that
Sherma:
	To be seen 
	I'll go gentle on you today since you're not well 
	Won't annoy or frustrate you 
	Let me talk to you in a bit, wanna get a few things done 
Ish:
	Ok
	If you in any way feel I'm gloating ( I'm not) we don't have to talk about it 
	Don't want you to feel beaten down anymore or vice versa over heat and get a blue vagina as well
	Or blue uterus either 
Sherma:
	In about way sound foreign to you but I don't overthink everything 
	It may sound 
Ish:
	I'm believe you ..... I always have its a big turn on 
	Why I want you to believe in me so badly
Sherma:

Ish:

Sherma:
	I'm and out doing shit cuz I was not home yesterday 
Ish:

	üòúüòúüòú

Sherma:

Ish:
	No more hyping yourself I see my lady lol!!
Sherma:
	Hopefully all of this would have been worth it 
Ish:
	Best ever talk not a sales pitch is out the window 
	Having you say yes was worth it! All I ever really wanted 
	Only word that matters most to me
	Busy wanna ask you a question ? 
Sherma:
	I'm sure being with me will be the best adventure you'll ever have 
	So I'm not worried

	Saying yes
	Making me happier
	A lot happier
	Hope you realize this might be the best date of your like my lady
	Like = life
	No sales pitch 
	I wanna ask you a question about our last planned date that never happened is that ok?
	I know you don't like revising the past 
Sherma:
	Sure 
Ish:
	Hypothetically speaking of course...... You seem to have it all figured out and such ... Any chance if things got really hot (yesterday)with us during the spooning seasons it might've led to us going all the way?  You did say only 2 kisses for our 2nd date and we exceeded those expectations
	Seasons = sessions
Sherma:
	My head would have stopped me 
Ish:
	And you don't think all the time 
	Real foreign to me
	Then I'm glad we didn't do it.... It would've been awesome but bittersweet for me!
Sherma:
	I know how far I wanted to go and probably play at around with the idea but not follow thru
Ish:
	After our next date I'll ask you the same question , ok? And see if you say the same thing 
	For our 1st time I will approach it like the outcome would be undetermined my gift to you , deal?
Sherma:
	Why sound like god's gift to women 
Ish:
	Got this far ..... You still doubt me?
	Can I ask another hypothetical about yesterday ?
Sherma:
	Ask away 
Ish:
	Any chance you would've let me go down on you? 
Sherma:
	Depends on how intense it became 
Ish:
	Lol! That's a yes
Sherma:
	I didn't say yes 
Ish:
	And you would've let me go down but not penetrate?
	Intense please that's a given
Sherma:
	Yea?? And 
Ish:
	Find it hard to believe but it's hot either way
	üî•üî•üî•üî•
	Do you like the deal I offered? 
Sherma:
	Don't underestimate my sense of self control 
	It's a reasonable deal 
Ish:
	I don't underestimate your self control just moral compass that's all
	Which do you prefer? Any preferences if you wanna try and replicate the date yesterday I'm up for it ..... See what I bring 
	See how quick you break
Sherma:
	What ?? I don't break 
Ish:
	Never say never
Sherma:
	Bend but not break 
Ish:
	I mean I'll make u ask me for it ..... You understand can't take it anymore 
	Deal or no deal? Ill give you a 1 hour time limit see if you make it no penetration 1st hour see who caves 
	Deal?
	Loser pays for next date room deal?
	And bragging rights ofcourse which are priceless 
Sherma:
	You don't me well enough 
	When my head takes over my body shuts down 
	Systematically 
	You just made it harder for yourself 
	Sorry, be prepared to put it on your card the next time 
Ish:
	Lol
	Likewise
Sherma:
	Ent happening 
	My last name means lion 
	First name - contentment 
	Cast system - warrior 
	Sign - bull 
	Who do you think got this 
Ish:
	Look at you ! That's my lady !
	At her strongest fighting me 
	Can't wait to see who's all talk 
Sherma:
	I grew up with brothers whom I played football with 
	Fist fight with 
	You got nothing on me 
Ish:
	Nice to know now we will both get what we want eventually on our next date a win /win 
	Ain't I a genius?
Sherma:
	Either that or not so smart 
	Cuz am never defeated 
Ish:
	The first hours gonna be one for the ages 
	After that if you win then we still gonna do it , ok?
	You understand the deal me lady I hope
	All you have to do is hold out for 1 hour after its on!! 
	Or did I just screw myself and you not gonna do it at all
Sherma:
	On the 61st min I'll give in 
Ish:
	Your are amazing 
	Do you like the deal ? Make it more interesting 
	Also what if at 61st minute I go double or nothing?
Sherma:
	Too much 
	The deal stands as is 
Ish:
	Ok my lady 
	Nice to know you know your limits
Sherma:
	They say never trust the silent ones, am not a big talker 
Ish:
	Sure fooled me 
Sherma:

Ish:

	See my lady I'm always looking out for your best interest 
	All you need to do is let go I got you
Sherma:

Sherma:
	Getting dress, you've corroded my mind plenty
	Going to the temple üôè

	Love being on the same page with you thx!!
Sherma:

	Being thirsty 
Ish:
	Of course the PC answer my lady smh
Sherma:
	Wyd now ?
Ish:
	Moving a lil money around and setting up appointment for counseling my lady 
	You need anything ? Free to chat or busy 
	Still in bed on my MacBook in my office 
Sherma:
	Apt for counseling ?? Care to elaborate 
Ish:
	Sure ..... When I left Baldwin I thought I'd be slick and not tell my PO about the move but when it was discovered I was no longer there and that I moved out my mom and grandma live in a different county! So I had to get a new PO and my new PO wants me to go see an alcohol counselor and be evaluated so I need to find a new counselor 
	My aunt works as a counselor and said she refer me to one close to here .. It sucks in a way but it's probably for best to keep me in check .... My biggest tendency to self destruct is when things are going well in my life.... You being good for me this counseling being bad hopefully keeps me centered long enough to be great again 
	Did I elaborate enough my lady?
Sherma:
	Yup 
Ish:
	We cool? Still on for later in week?
Sherma:

Ish:

	Hey maybe I'm getting better humor starting to come back
	You started it tho with dehydrated comment to be perfectly honest 
	I followed your lead 
Sherma:
	Please as if you weren't thinking about it 
Ish:
	Thinking for me is over my lady..... Just feel grateful and concerned with getting better 
	It would be a lie not to say I'm turned on by you
	Your a very sexy being
	Honestly don't think you've ever been pushed to your limits you will be next date and for me knowing what you don't is biggest turn on lol! 
	The tables will be turned and my lady's big ego will be knocked down a notch or two .... And that's all I'm gonna say
Sherma:
	All I'm gonna say is that I've been at the border line of limits 
Ish:
	Always feel obligated to discredit me in some way I'm done talking about it. You win for the moment 
	Seeing you eat crow will be priceless

Ish:

Sherma:
	Beginning was his 
	Then it became mine

Sherma:
	Did you see it as a dirty thing ?
Ish:
	Wanna know why or should we wait til Friday ?
Sherma:

Ish:
	Let's revisit this later ...
	You said earlier when the time comes I can have you in any positions any amount of times is that still true?
Sherma:
	Still true 
	Tell me 1st why ur not into it 
Ish:
	Never said I wasn't into it said it never been offered don't know if I'd be into it neve done it
	I'm pretty simple in bedroom. Not against being adventurous all good as long as it's with you
	Whatever u want I'll do we seem very similar in that regard 
	Quite compatible it appears what you think?
Sherma:
	Did you not ask your wife if she wanted to 
	You were married long enough to be comfortable to ask 
Ish:
	Might've in jest lol! To see if she was interested more of a test I guess
	Your funny and cute lol! With your questions priceless
	Again, You think we compatible ?
	I'm pretty sure my wife had done anal before lol 
	Your cute
Sherma:
	Why didn't you do it with her ?
Ish:
	Cuz I'm big you silly willy 
	I don't think you'll be too excited either about the proposition come Friday either 
	But then again you seem to always wanna prove me wrong lol!!!
Sherma:
	Question , why don't you like oral on yourself ?
Ish:
	Awww no last word on the anal front?  
	I rather penetrate or give 
Sherma:
	Didn't answer my question fully 
Ish:
	Which question ?
Sherma:
	You getting 
Ish:
	I think you'll prefer the other two options as well
Sherma:
	Stop deflecting 
Ish:
	You said both I know I'll prove you wrong guess I'll be the exception to the rule for u
	You wanna give me oral np I'll be grateful
Sherma:
	I'm asking 
	You're not suppose to be grateful, it's meant to be pleasurable 
Ish:
	The thought of ejaculating in a woman's mouth isn't the most appealing thing for me
	I'd rather kiss ur mouth
	While I fuck u
	Sound like fun? U in?
	Try it my way ü§î
Sherma:
	I like kissing you 
Ish:
	Did I answer ur question better?
Sherma:
	I'm satisfied 
Ish:
	You like my answer?
Sherma:
	Yes
Ish:
	You gonna let me kiss you while I penetrate you?
Sherma:
	Yes
Ish:
	So see how the number of positions starts to narrow lol?
	We compatible Sherma ?
Sherma:
	I think so
Ish:
	That had to hurt to say took like 4 times to ask
Sherma:
	I don't like questions based on feelings
Ish:
	Do you enjoy this line of questioning over last weeks?
	Only questions that matter in the big picture or should I say only answers that matter
	I know you don't wanna feel hurt follows after 
Sherma:
	 I do prefer this line of questioning as oppose to last week 
Ish:
	Yeah!!! Is there even a small part of you that's happy with my nonstop barrage on you my lady?
	Last week barrage of questions and demands I'm referring to
Sherma:
	Not happy with those 
	Being honest 
	It felt like a marriage 
Ish:
	But we did Come to an understanding and I feel better off 
	I feel we are better now and we will be even better after Friday but I'm also aware of your no commitment request so I see why waiting could be in your best interest 
	I will honor my lady's wishes 
	Didn't feel like a marriage to me lol !! 
	Me and my wife never talked much 
	Didn't need to
Sherma:
	Why not?
Ish:
	In due time my lady it's not a sprint 
	We good?
Sherma:
	We talking right?
	Why not ?
	If it's gonna annoy you then don't answer 
	Besides I don't care

	Now you expect the hour to start when we enter the room lol! Your the best! Very Cute
	Its ok‚Ä¶. we can cancel the bet np‚Ä¶.. Its worth in not hearing about contentment and lions and warriors nonsense!!
Sherma:
	Afraid to loose ?
Ish:
	lose not loose‚Ä¶.. I won‚Äôt lose
	Your already trying to change the bet lol
	Counting snuggling and undressing for christs sake

Ish:

Ish:
	Promise to go for it on friday don‚Äôt worry
Sherma:
	Did she sleep with you too fast ?
	Was it not a challenge to get ?
	Was she too easy ?
Ish:
	Exactly‚Ä¶. she felt that anyway‚Ä¶. Then felt she needed to make me wait more
	Never too easy for me, IMHO
	I enjoy easy ‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt hold a girls desire for me against them EVER
	She felt I got it too easy and it made her feel maybe a bit uneasy I Suppose‚Ä¶ felt tricked by me I guess ‚Ä¶.. Alcohol lots of it were involved
	Like I said if I sleep with a girl in first 15 mins or it takes 15 dates don‚Äôt matter my opinion on them. I have choice where I put my penis
	I‚Äôm simple so simple you are gonna be shocked my lady
	Sure I‚Äôm smart thoughtful and God gave me the gift of gab but I‚Äôd prefer to get by with less
	Understand what I mean by breaking now? 
Sherma:
	Yep
Ish:
	You gonna break?
Sherma:
	It will take more than you to break me 
Ish:
	thats my girl
	Excited for friday? Feeling comfortable with the way its playing out?
	Not too soon?
Sherma:
	Definitely to soon 
	But I'm a big girl 
	I want nor expect anything from you 
Ish:

Ish:

	No, November wasn't mine 
Ish:

Sherma:

Ish:

	I‚Äôll take it though thx
Sherma:
	Remember you said to me, I won't care if you have a boyfriend.  I will  have to try harder to win you over 
	Because I will know your worth 
Ish:
	Didn‚Äôt mean it like that‚Ä¶. but I see your point
	You know me well enough‚Ä¶ trying harder is probably a bit delusional haven‚Äôt I tried hard enough lol
Sherma:
	Hell no 
	There haven't been any road blocks this far 
Ish:
	Road blocks 10 dates wasn‚Äôt a road block are you kidding

	Simple will be your new favorite word
	Simple and holding on for dear life is what I recommend you getting used to my lady
	Please don‚Äôt scar me is all I ask reason i asked about your aggressive comments
Sherma:
	I like to initiate sex 
Ish:
	Sure fooled me sister theresa
Sherma:
	It's always the innocent ones 
Ish:
	Were you feeling sexual my lady on the steps with me last time?
Sherma:
	Feeling something 
Ish:
	Puhlease‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ you lost control a bit and track of time
Sherma:
	I did not lose control 
Ish:
	Cuz the environment wasn‚Äôt ideal‚Ä¶ but in no way were you conscious of our surroundings that‚Äôll much you have to admit
	It was a good time‚Ä¶. don‚Äôt minimzeit
	minimize it
Sherma:
	Please, I had to get you off of me 
Ish:
	You wish was only half stepping my lady
Sherma:
	You have selective memory 
Ish:
	Taking it easy on you, respecting your virtue
	No half stepping friday‚Ä¶.. thats why you won‚Äôt last 15 mins never the full hour
	Do you orgasm easier thru oral or penetration Sherma?
Sherma:
	You haven't called me by my name in forever. Seems weird reading it 
	Simply kissing does it for me, during oral if my knees quiver it's their and when my toes curl it's penetration 
	Doesn't take much 
Ish:
	You were close to reaching Orgasm on the steps then Sherma admit it
	Do I kiss differently then your used to?
Sherma:
	I was just about 
Ish:
	You mean it?
Sherma:
	Yep

Sherma:
	Def not 
Ish:
	Thx , different then you expected? Different then most guys you dated?
Sherma:
	Take the 5
	Would say that I def wanted you at that moment 
Ish:
	thx‚Ä¶ what about on our 2nd date when I first kissed you
Sherma:
	I wanted to kiss you more 
Ish:
	Likewise‚Ä¶.
	And you still think it‚Äôs too soon Sherma?
Sherma:
	My head says yes 
	My body says differently 
	I follow my head 
Ish:
	So I was right when I kept harassing you that was the case
Sherma:
	Yup
Ish:
	I know you pretty well does that scare u
Sherma:
	I don't like it 
Ish:
	Y
Sherma:
	It makes me vulnerable 
Ish:
	Not if u trust me it shouldn't 
Sherma:
	Don't take it personal but I trust no one 
Ish:
	You‚Äôve said that before nice to know your consistent
	You said earlier that like you to initiate sex‚Ä¶.. What did you think after we kissed a few times know how aggressive I can be? 
	you like‚Ä¶. not like you
Sherma:
	I like very much 
Ish:
	Thought since you like to initiate might‚Äôve put things to your head or mind as you say
	Do most guys you date or meet get your body to say Yes so quickly?
Sherma:
	If the chemistry is their, yes 
	Don't ask if you can't handle honesty, okay?
Ish:
	All good Sherma‚Ä¶..I can handle it, appreciate your honesty.  When did you start to  feel chemistry with us?
Sherma:
	2nd date 
Ish:
	Cmon!!
	Seriously? 
	Didn‚Äôt feel any chemistry before scheduling our 1st? Thought we had a solid connection before ever meeting in person to be perfectly honest
Sherma:
	1st was flirtatious 
Ish:
	Cuz you were very nervous and couldn‚Äôt handle any of my moves
	Or you would‚Äôve broke
Sherma:
	I like the way you can't put your ego on the side for a bit 
Ish:
	Not saying sex sherma, but would‚Äôve been chemical
	Just being honest‚Ä¶. Don‚Äôt try and fool me if you can‚Äôt handle honesty, okay?
Sherma:
	Before scheduling the 1st date, you intrigued me. You challenged me and I liked that 
	That's the reason I went out with you 
Ish:
	So my wit doesn‚Äôt or didn‚Äôt create chemistry with you?
Sherma:
	No you annoyed me cuz you seemed cocky 
	And arrogant 
Ish:
	But it got you out on a date‚Ä¶ smh
	Woman I tell ya
Sherma:
	I wanted to break you 
Ish:
	lol
	You wanna know the moment when I started to break?
	Care to guess?
Sherma:
	When I left you at the station 
Ish:
	You wish
	I already told you no kissing
	Your lying if a part of you didn‚Äôt want to kiss
Sherma:
	No I didn't want to kiss you 
	But wanted you to want me 
	When did I break you ???
Ish:
	Understand I said when I started to break‚Ä¶. not broke
	A full break would‚Äôve been me breaking up with you understand
	Thats what I mean by break basically can‚Äôt take the heat anymore understand? 
Sherma:
	Misread 
Ish:
	Ego likes to run with things Sherma
Sherma:
	Shud up 
Ish:
	lol! 
	I knew you were gonna say that‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. Swear to god
	That‚Äôs a ‚Ä¶‚Äù damn I want you very badly take me Artie‚Äù ‚Ä¶. Shud up, Admit it Sherma‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.
	But I‚Äôm too vulnerable so I can‚Äôt ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
	Am I right?
Sherma:
	Could you catch up with your ego 
	You don't know me 
Ish:
	You said earlier I did about the mind vs body stuff‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Which is it?
Sherma:
	Shud up 
Ish:
	lol!
	Just shud up and fuck you correct?
Sherma:
	Yup 
Ish:
	Lol!!
	Your da best!!
Sherma:
	How long did it take you to realize that ?
Ish:
	Jury still out‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll let you know after next date‚Ä¶.. got emotional for a second it happens
	Bet you never thought texting could get say hot my lady, agreed?
Sherma:
	All I heard is that you got emotional 
Ish:
	Atleast one of us isn‚Äôt afraid to express his feelings
	Back to chemistry in regards to you Sherma?  Does chemistry for you have degrees or levels or is it at 100% all time and thats why you need you mind as a safety valve per se?
Sherma:
	I will say levels 
	The higher it goes the more mindful I am 
	Does it make sense to you ?
Ish:
	Yup
	Any idea what level I am on your meter?
Sherma:
	On the level where I would really like to fuck you 
	And not say "fuck your"
Ish:
	Lol! Thats why you didn‚Äôt consider ending it with me last week
Sherma:
	You were on the edge 
	One more and you would have been gone 
Ish:
	One more what exactly?
	You asked me to end it a few times if I remember correctly 
Sherma:
	Like I had enough of the conversation 
	One more fight and I was done 
Ish:
	Sorry‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. glad it‚Äôs over
	Make love not war, correct?
	You forgive me yet Sherma?
Sherma:
	For being a jerk?? Yes
Ish:
	Thx
	I forgive you too
Sherma:
	What?
	I remember this conversation going in circles. 
	Don't respond 
	Am just gonna let it go 
Ish:
	Smart
	Do you recommend I go in circles when I go down on you?
Sherma:
	Shud up
Ish:
	üëÖ
	When you sent me the pic of how you look from the back, that‚Äôs when I starting breaking‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. Said to myself I gotta have that
	Im a visual person more than words‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. not only did it surprise me you‚Äôd send me the pic‚Ä¶. it got the blood flowing places 
	Couple pints worth
	Then it took all my resolve to not completely break after the 10th decree Sherma! Would‚Äôve tried but it wouldn‚Äôt been more for spite possibly 
	Felt neither of us deserved that
Sherma:
	As much as I love having sex I have no problems waiting 
	It's not the most important thing to me 
Ish:
	I know I called it early with your discipline and stubborness or do I need to remind you?
	Fwiw our next fight won't be for quite a while don't worry I can predict these things 
	Did you have chemistry for me before you sent me those lovely pics ?
Sherma:
	Don't recall when I sent it 
	And what was going on at the time 
	Omg it's late 
	I've been talking to you forever 
Ish:
	I'm not asking when u sent it but why Sherma? Chemistry or not
	I make you lose time Sherma agreed?
Sherma:
	You do, it's not a good thing 
Ish:
	Of course!! Is there any effect I have on you that's a "good thing" Sherma?
Sherma:
	If the pic was sent after the 2nd date, there was chemistry 
Ish:
	That's my girl! 
	You tapping is now on that note Sherma?
	Is = out
Sherma:
	I know wat you meant 
	Tapping in about 15 mins 
Ish:
	Just got out of the shower feeling pretty good should be back to myself very soon ! üí™‚úä
Sherma:
	Good 
	Good 
	I love taking bubble bath 
	With candles, music and glass of wine 
	That's how I like to relax 
Ish:
	Sounds hot 
	I'm a shower guy but I'm sure I'd be open to making an exception in your case when you heal
Sherma:
	Epsom salt with lavender oil heals quickly, you might need it 
	Try to pick it up for yourself before the snow tomorrow 
Ish:
	Don't worry Sherma I'll be ready to answer the bell
	Your the one who needs to heal not me
Sherma:
	I've never met anyone as cocky as you 
	Damn you're on a different level 
Ish:
	Have I backed it up?
	You asked for honesty
	If you can't handle my honesty don't ask okay?
Sherma:
	Okay 
	Libra suppose to mean that you're balance, correct ?
Ish:
	I guess..... All I can say pretty confidently is that it's the best sign! My first two gfs were libras as well go figure
	Jury is still out on Taurus !!
Sherma:
	Well to be honest it doesn't matter what anyone thinks about me, more importantly is what I think of myself 
Ish:
	Correct I've been telling you that for a long time my lady ! Do I need to repost the "words are just words" tirade?  Back to my original question Sherma! Have I backed any of my cockiness up?
Sherma:
	To an extent 
Ish:
	What haven't I please be honest 
Sherma:
	I'll be going to bed soon 
Ish:
	Don't wanna tell you how I have and then you accuse me of throwing it back in your face Sherma 
Sherma:
	Can I ask you say something nice 
	I'm be tapping out soon 
	Pretend I'm ur gf
Ish:
	Sure you anything Sherma you know that 
Sherma:
	And talk to me 
Ish:
	Going forward? 
Sherma:
	Pretend 
Ish:
	Hmmmm
	We haven't had sex otherwise I don't need to pretend much kinda do already talk to you like that
	I normally don't talk to women Sherma 
	Only if I'm interested with something in them 
	So the fact I talk to you says a lot
Sherma:
	So are you interested with something in me ?
Ish:
	You know that how many times I say it
	You don't want me remember ?
Sherma:
	I spend countless hours with you 
Ish:
	Helloooo wasn't that my point in my tantrums you detest so much

	Getting off at 330?
Sherma:
	Yea
	Typical of me ?
Ish:
	not staying late‚Ä¶ probably not typical ‚Äî you stated you usually stay until ‚Äújob is completed to your satisfaction‚Äù
	Is that not typical anymore?
Sherma:
	Felling much better ?
Ish:
	yup
Sherma:
	Get off at 3.30 doesn't always mean that I leave on time 
Ish:
	7:30 - 3:30 no?
Sherma:
	Yes 
	I left at 4.15 yesterday 
Ish:
	Then how is 330 not getting off on time , ok
	When you left at 415 was the job completed to your satisfaction

Sherma:
	I very thorough. Are you anxious for some reason?
Ish:
	Define anxious?
Sherma:
	Checking up on my timeline 
Ish:
	Just wondering what time to expect you friday‚Ä¶ any idea when you‚Äôll be free?
Sherma:
	5 ish
	Is that good 
Ish:
	Yup‚Ä¶..
	can I ask another question?
Sherma:
	Don't ask if I'm excited !!
Ish:
	Please Im not you I‚Äôm not that predictable
	Yes or no?
	Obviously your answer there proves your excitement thx 
	üòú
	Ready for my question?
	?
Sherma:
	So god damn predictable 
	Yup 
Ish:
	Sure?
	üêì?
Sherma:
	Yup
	Waiting 
Ish:
	You stated the other day you don‚Äôt like the term ‚Äújob‚Äù used for a description of partner‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Does that mean come friday when we together that you won‚Äôt be ‚Äúthorough‚Äù and that the job won‚Äôt be completed to ‚Äúsatisfaction‚Äù ???
	Waiting‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.
Sherma:
	You haven't disappoint yet :)
Ish:
	Don‚Äôt understand the answer my lady‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Is it your plans on Friday to be thorough with me and complete the job to my satisfaction? Yes or no‚Ä¶.
Sherma:
	Dont ask about the hype :(
	Hold on 
	I skim not read thoroughly 
	Sorry 
Ish:
	I guess when it comes to  me thorough doesn‚Äôt apply üòü
Sherma:
	It's my intent to make sure you get what you want 
	I'm not selfish 
Ish:
	Once you agreed to it ‚Ä¶.I got what I want‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. now its time to celebrate ‚Ä¶.. just relax my lady don‚Äôt worry it‚Äôll be ok don‚Äôt want you to implode from the pressure‚Ä¶. Just show up all I ask‚Ä¶ 
	take deep breaths and relax can you handle that?
	Don‚Äôt want you to collapse from the stress‚Ä¶. this is all fun‚Ä¶. ok? No pressure
	Please don‚Äôt break before Friday‚Ä¶.ok?
Sherma:
	As long as you refer to it as the bedding ceremony or celebratory event 
	I'm good 
Ish:
	What shouldn‚Äôt I refer ‚Äúit‚Äù to? Didn‚Äôt like the ‚Äúfotc‚Äù metaphor?
Sherma:
	Fuck will suffice 
	Don't sugar coat it for me 
Ish:
	Is there a discernible difference in your mind and vocabulary from ‚Äúfucking‚Äù and ‚Äúmaking love‚Äù?
Sherma:
	Making love is an intimate act, with feelings and shit. Fuck is just that, a fuck 
Ish:
	What do you expect or want it to be on Friday?
	?
	waiting my lady 
Sherma:
	Just spending time with you is sufficient for me 
Ish:
	Cmon!!!
	Talk to me‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. Ask and it will be rewarded‚Ä¶.. 
Sherma:
	I'm sure you will fill me up 
Ish:
	Playing to my ego will not give you a pass my lady
	Nice try
	You wanna ‚ÄúFuck‚Äù or ‚ÄúMake love‚Äù on Friday?
Sherma:
	Fuck after the 61st min
Ish:
	k but it‚Äôll be more 31 min
	more like 31st min
	Thought you were gonna give the PC answer and say both
	Probably saying to yourself‚Ä¶.‚ÄùYeah‚Ä¶ why didn‚Äôt I?
Sherma:
	Damn, to late to retract 
Ish:
	Yup, appears I‚Äôm in your head big time got you over thinking everything lol
Sherma:
	Don't wanna step on you pal 
	Just distracted 
Ish:
	Of course
	Must be
Sherma:
	Where's ur sense of humor 
	Sick ??
Ish:
	Its there‚Ä¶.. I‚Äôm better don‚Äôt worry‚Ä¶. maybe 75-80%
	Can‚Äôt joke all the time ‚Ä¶.. don‚Äôt wanna be predictable all the time and show some maturity
Sherma:
	Don't want you anything less than 10% sir
	100%
Ish:
	Thats a nice gesture. But me at 75-80 will still rock your world
	On our dates I was never at 100% anyway thanks to your restrictions my lady
	Be careful what you wish for
Sherma:
	Whatever you put out there I could handle 
Ish:
	No chance not even if that ring of yours has superpowers my lady‚Ä¶. you‚Äôve finally met your match
Sherma:
	M not scared, are you ?
Ish:
	Scared of what? You not showing ? 
	50/50 on that lol!!
	Had 5 dates schedule and you‚Äôve shown up for 3‚Ä¶.. so a no-show this time puts you rate at 3 for 6 0r 50%
	rate = right
	jk
Sherma:
	If I do a no show, what's the end result 
	Cold feet , nerves , whatever 
	??
	We still gonna be twins 
Ish:
	Reschedule I suppose‚Ä¶. those thoughts haven‚Äôt really entered my mind
	Same as last time‚Ä¶ reschedule I have faith in my lady
	If you reschedule for the Dr that could be the end 
	So my final answer is it depends, but most likely I‚Äôd reschedule unless in some way it‚Äôs deemed a slap in my face or kick in my balls .  But its not something I‚Äôd rather spend time on thinking about
Sherma:
	Fair enough 
	Do you know all you need to know about me ?
	Any questions ?
Ish:
	Questions about what exactly?
Sherma:
	Dunno
	Any part of the puzzle is missing for you ?
Ish:
	Im sure you‚Äôll surprise me 
	Expect the unexpected with woman
Sherma:
	Everytime 
	Same with a man 
Ish:
	But about you specifically‚Ä¶. I have a good sense of my lady
	Do you know all you need to know about me ?
Sherma:
	Too much 
Ish:
	Is that a good or bad thing?
Sherma:
	It's all good 
Ish:
	So its all good you say and you know ‚Äútoo much‚Äù about me‚Ä¶. Saying all that do you still feel or think that Friday is happening ‚Äútoo soon‚Äù?
Sherma:
	I'm never in a rush to sleep with someone 
	But when I do I always want more 
Ish:
	Sorry not a bad answer but you didn‚Äôt answer the question
	Do you still feel or think that Friday is happening ‚Äútoo soon‚Äù?
Sherma:
	Lol
	Hesitant
	Don't really know how to answer 
Ish:
	My lady not knowing‚Ä¶. wow!!!
Sherma:
	Looking forward to it and yet hesitant 
Ish:
	Would you feel any differently if Friday was our 10th date?
Sherma:
	Yes 
	It won't feel like I rushed it 
Ish:
	You wouldn‚Äôt feel hesitant after 10 dates?
Sherma:
	I don't think so 
	But then ur talking about me 
	When shit start happening I tend to forget about time :)
Ish:
	So it might‚Äôve happened Saturday then
	In reality then Friday is longer than it should‚Äôve taken IMHO
Sherma:
	Def won't have happen on sat 
	Cuz my mind was already made up not to do anything 
Ish:
	whatever
	Have you ever been ‚Äúhesitant‚Äù to sleep with another guy before?
Sherma:
	I've never made plans 
	It happen 
Ish:
	Why then didn‚Äôt I have that option?
Sherma:
	We've only recently met 
Ish:
	Soooooo
Sherma:
	Hence the reason 
Ish:
	You lost me
Sherma:
	The people I've slept with I knew for a long time 
	It wasn't weeks 
Ish:
	I understand took long time for you to seduce them I guess
	See my lady how easy I am‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
	üëç
Sherma:
	You are easy 
	But I didn't have to seduce anyone 
Ish:
	If you say so
	Sure couldn‚Äôt seduce me‚Ä¶.. I‚Äôve been the seductor and the aggressive one don‚Äôt forget that
Sherma:
	That's becuz you wanted my ass 
	From the jump 
Ish:
	After you sent the pic of it my lady lets not rewrite history
	And yes I do want you‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ badly
	But please keep the ego at bay‚Ä¶..
	üòçüòòüòú
Sherma:
	A pic did that for you and not me ? Smh
Ish:
	I don‚Äôt understand‚Ä¶ just admit I won the round‚Ä¶ get used to it for Friday I
	New topic, ok?
Sherma:
	I gave you the win 
Ish:
	We will call it a tie, then‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. Rather give then receive remember‚Ä¶ you don‚Äôt have to give me anything
Sherma:
	You're starting to get under my skin 
Ish:
	Its not all good anymore?
	My lady upset?
	I was just trying to be cute not push buttons
Sherma:
	Get under my skin meaning that I'm liking you 
Ish:
	As you would say What took you so long?
Sherma:
	That's not where I wanna go my twin 
	But you're growing on me 
Ish:
	Honestly‚Ä¶.
	Have you ever met anyone like me?
Sherma:
	Not as annoying, no 
Ish:
	Whatever‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. so predictable
Sherma:
	Lol 
Ish:
	üëÜ
Sherma:
	Keeping it consistent 
Ish:
	So even though Im getting ‚Äúunder your skin‚Äù and I growing on you ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Still think Friday is too soon? 
Sherma:
	Yes for the 50 th time
	You're not talking to me 
	Okayyss
Ish:
	Not an official vow of silence but why talk when whats most important to you is time
	I said earlier and meant it about giving‚Ä¶.. So how you think it  gives me a good feeling when I feel like your ‚Äúgiving in to me‚Äù this Friday?
Sherma:
	Winning feeling üòú
Ish:
	Maybe it‚Äôs about winning for you ‚Ä¶ not me
Sherma:
	:((
	Talk to you soon 
	G2g
Ish:
	Be safe
Sherma:
	Always 
	Hey 
Ish:
	Hi 
Sherma:
	Remember that popping sound in my mouth ?
Ish:
	Yup how could I forget 
Sherma:
	The piercings that I did recently closer to my eardrums 
	Creates that problem 
	Just got back from the doctor
Ish:
	Is it painful?
Sherma:
	No, but annoying to hear 
	Pet peeve 
Ish:
	I didn't hear it was just kidding when I said it 
Sherma:
	But I can which bothers me 
Ish:
	So know open kissing this Friday?
	Know = no
Sherma:
	That's not it 
	Trying to explain the resin for that sound 
	Thought it was TMJ 
	But it's not 
Ish:
	Ok 
	Again I didn't hear it
Sherma:
	Bcuz you were breathing heavily 
Ish:
	I'm sure I won't hear it over all the moaning this Friday so I'm not too concerned 
	Looking for an excuse to cancel my lady?
	üêì
Sherma:
	Shud up 
	And no I'm not 
Ish:
	Are my lady's nipples pierced?
Sherma:
	No
Ish:
	Clit?
Sherma:
	Wtf
	Go away 
Ish:
	Just asking my lady they are reasonable questions 
	You brought up piercings earlier you opened the door
	Is the sound you hear caused by the actual piercing or only if you have some sort of earring in the pierced hole?
Sherma:
	It's the location of the piecing that created the problem 
Ish:
	Sorry to hear guess the condition cant be remedied
Sherma:
	Nope 
	Anyways 
	That's basically wats up 
Ish:
	How long ago did you get the piercings?
Sherma:
	I have 2-3 months 
Ish:
	How often do your hear the noise or sound?
	The popping one
Sherma:
	I know how to control it or should I say minimize it 
	Depends on how wide I open my mouth 
	Small "O's"nothing, big "O's" I would hear it 
	I'll figure it out 
Ish:
	So meeting me and kissing me worsen the condition 
	I'm sorry
Sherma:
	It doesn't really 
Ish:
	Ever since we met seems your mouth went wide open maybe your mind wasn't aware of it but it's true 
	Willing the kissing be minimized now with us going forward?
Sherma:
	Not true, it's my eyes that's been rolling 
Ish:
	Cmon!! Be honest just once when it come to me
	You said you can minimize the condition does that mean less kisses for me?
Sherma:
	No it doesn't mean that silly 
Ish:
	You sure about that ... Your mind seems to fly way open ..... Did you advise your Dr about me he should know
	He might've treated some of my ex's
Sherma:
	Doubt it , you only give 
	Don't like receiving 
Ish:
	I like kissing 
Sherma:
	Me too 
Ish:
	I'm realizing that if you need to see a dr afterward 
	And you gonna last 61 mins seriously ?
	You wanna cancel this bet just for sake of you health and well being?
Sherma:
	My kissing is fine 
Ish:
	How about this......
Sherma:
	I got this 
	No worries 
Ish:
	I'll do the bet with you and win it but........
Sherma:
	Don't be tripping 
Ish:
	ONLY is you bring a doctor note my lady 
	No Dr note no bet it's for your own good 
Sherma:
	Who said you're gonna be winning, must be bugging 
Ish:
	Again, it's not about winning
	I care about your bests interests over winning 
	No Dr. Note no bet!
Sherma:
	I could call Chris 
Ish:
	You going there again?
	Really?
Sherma:
	you wanted a Drs note, no ??
	Okay that was low 
	Will take it back 
Ish:
	Was it Chris's diagnosis about your piercings?
	Ok good let's drop it!
	Water under the bridge thx 
Sherma:

Sherma:

Ish:

Sherma:
	Tenks 
	So I'm gonna be straight with you 
Ish:
	What you mean.... There's more your not telling me?
Sherma:
	Since I haven't been w anyone for a long time , you would have to be a bit gentle with me 
	To start with 
Ish:
	Sure always gentle my lady .... True gentleman I am
	You can even direct me I'm a very good attentive listener
Sherma:
	I'm sure you know what you doing 
Ish:
	Trust me?
Sherma:
	Putting my body in your hands 
Ish:
	Can you get viagra?
Sherma:
	Wtf
Ish:
	I have a confession ok?
Sherma:
	Go for it 
Ish:
	In my younger years probably due to immaturity and insecurity I dabbled a bit too much with steroids 
	It caused me in the last few years to have low testosterone levels 
	Partly causing me depression and hurt my marriage sex life
	Started using viagra and cialis and things got much better
	My niece on the ex side used to get me a script for it was a lil embarrassing at 1st but it really helped my condition 
	Just don't think it's appropriate to ask her now would seem suspicious don't ya think?
	Meeting you Has really got the blood flowing 
	You have that affect my lady reason I pushed so hard to see what happens and if it was partly due to my mind and stress from things in marriage and legal stuff
	I'll definitely should be able to get up atleast once but if you can get the pills we be in real good shape!!üëçüëçüëç
	Think you can help us?
	You ok with this? Want no surprises on Friday you've been straight with me thx
Sherma:

	It's been a while for me too ... It'll be over before you know it lol

	Seem = see me
Sherma:

	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfLI85peZrY
Sherma:
	Hey good morning, needed time to think about you and I. You wear you heart on your sleeves and you are truly a great guy. It will be cruel of me to have you emotionally invested and hurt you. I am going through a divorce and having many fluctuating feelings on any given day from wanting to fall in love again to throwing my hands up in disgust over the whole thing. The only thing I can ascertain is that I know is that I'm not ready to be involve with anyone right now. Don't want to drag someone through my divorce. Being with me your life is rapidly changing, I don't want to be responsible for its decline. It hurts me to say it but I'm tapping out, I'm really very, very sorry. You are a great guy, don't settle for less. 
Ish:
	Wow! You broke! Does that mean we aren't going to spend today/ tonight together? 
	Ouch! Starting to sink in surprising you gave up on me  sooo soon that's crueler IMO then giving it a chance....so I become your 1st one night (2 hour) stand lol! Expect the unexpected I said -smh. I'm not gonna sugar coat it this hurts! Sorry I rushed you if that was the case it'll probably torment me for a long time. Maybe I'll become a  Buddhist monk! I'm truly  speechless ü§ê! üò§ 
	You should honor today tho IMHO so we can say goodbye the right way! You did promise! 
	And fwiw! You inclined my consciousness not declined it and you might think I'm a great guy (whatever) but really I'm not in most female eyes only the select few like you my twin! Still twins ? Don't don't do this! Let's spend  today together and discuss this, thx my lady! 

PS: I don't give up .... I won't spam you but cmon can't we talk about this cuz I'm not buying this "I'm doing you a favor nonsense " in your Dear John text you sent me! 
	Also‚Ä¶.. The only thing Id believe in your DJ post was this‚Ä¶‚ÄùThe only thing I can ascertain is that I know is that I'm not ready to be involve with anyone right now.‚Äù  Fortunately for me and you ‚Ä¶ you also said many more times before ‚Äú I don‚Äôt sleep with just anyone!‚Äù Therefore putting 2 and 2 together I‚Äôm must not be ‚Äúanyone‚Äù! Whoosh I did dodge a bullet there‚Ä¶.a close one!  You promised today, don‚Äôt back out you are bound to me tonite by my lady‚Äôs honor!  See you at 5! Rockville centre don‚Äôt be late!  Besides my lady needs a new phone and it‚Äôs more than just coincidence you know where the Verizon store is!!  Whoo hoo‚Ä¶.. You even said that I shouldn‚Äôt settle for less, lol‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm taking your advice and not settling for less then seeing you pretty face today at 5! Can‚Äôt wait!!  
	Soooo your not even gonna ever speak to me again? (I know it's a dumb question from last 24 hours or so)
	What a fucken joke!!!!!! You say ur not selfish ..... How selfish and pathetic it that!!!!
	You say you wouldn't walk from me if I had ED but do anyway wow!!!
	I know your done talking! What a bunch a bull you really spewed on me in last 24 hours! 
	Mrs i claim to be happy all the time dumps me for making her too happy!!! Joke!!!
	Liar joke fraud!!!!!!! Mrs I want the truth ..... Does not but that 
	Not ='nothing'
	Guyanese girl lasted 15 years with me the trini girl couldn't last 15mins wow!!! 
	Don't wanna hear no more bs about trini girls no more !!!
	Bottom line I'm venting a bit! I'm not really mad at you! Mad you left me but not at you! But don't for 1 second think I believe the reason you gave! How you don't want me to settle! I never settle regardless and let me decide if and when it's over for us.......I have much better and clearer judgement then you! And obviously more fight and less give up then Mrs softee on the other end
	Chemistry dictates when it's over and we don't fall in that category! Besides you'll never forgive yourself admitting defeat to me anyway! Not only do I win if you walk cuz you fell too hard and can't handle me so does your ex as well! Lol!!! And when your less emotional you will realize this!  See ya in a few hours thx !!! It's ok I forgive you!
	FWIW.....Your EX would win as well cuz you would allow his black cloud to no only ruin what you guys had but ruin us which who knows could've been even better since your better now then you were in your twenties lol! 
	Lastly 2 things I'd like to know 1. please confirm again your not meeting with me tonight and that your going against your solemn oath! And 2. Why did the other 2 guys you dated after get 6 months and 4 months to end it and I only get a few weeks ? Was I that much worse? Thx 
	Get out while you still can lol! What a pussy move.... Cmon my lady let's talk about this ..... I always said I see both sides I understand point made...... Your a stronger woman then this you are I believe in you!  Bend don't break if your not coming to meet atleast call me! Thx

	I might have a big penis lol didn't know it turn a lion into a lil scaredy cat
	GN!
	So your done talking to me?
Sherma:
	Hey
	As long as you don't try and change my mind 
Ish:
	You really dumping me?
	I understand if you need time but quitting on me that's mean
Sherma:
	I can't be anything significant to you 
Ish:
	Why not?
	You are already significant to me don't tell me what to feel
Sherma:
	I'm in no position to tell you how to feel or act, just saying I can't do this 
Ish:
	Why not? 
	How do you go from committing to Friday then to dumping me? Feels like your going out of your way to hurts me 
	By me just going away I feel like that's the easy way like a test your setting me up to see how much I care and see if this is only about Sex for me or something .....
Sherma:
	I swear this is not about you and never once did I think about hurting you 
	It's not a test, I don't wanna hurt you further, hence the reason I needed to end it all 
Ish:
	You never hurt me ...... Until you dumped me
	Your logic makes no sense ....... So you lie , mislead me then dump me so you won't hurt me further wtf Sherma
	If you don't want me I'm not gonna force you to date me
	But if you don't think for some strange reason your not good enough for me your wrongly mistaken 
	I like spending time with you it's not a game for me quite fun but not a game 
Sherma:
	Just to be on the same  page,  I made my intentions clear in the beginning 
	I didn't mislead you or lied. If you think this is easy for me then you're sadly mistaken 
Ish:
	What intentions clear?
	Friday was clear and you clearly went against your word 
Sherma:
	I'm sorry, can't say it enough 
Ish:
	Sorry is meaningless actions speak louder don't wanna hear sorry 
	Dumping one through a text is as easy as it gets 
	Avoiding them before and after is as well...... But I'm not hear to beat you up or hurt you or even change your mind! I want what's best for you 
	I don't understand how Us being together is bad ..... We aren't like Bonnie and Clyde we are not breaking laws or anything 
	We both going thru divorces 
	We both think similar and have great chemistry 
Sherma:
	That's what I do, I  fuck things up, once it becomes to cozy 
Ish:
	Purposely? 
	I Fuck things up all the time but it was never my intentions 
	All those stories I was saying on train the lost loves were bad mistakes I made and I like to think I've learned from them and become better cuz of it 
Sherma:
	Could we ever become just friends? 
	Or is it too late for that to happen 
Ish:
	Only forward
	Why can't we be snuggle buddies and stuff? Why don't you do what was promised to me 
	I'm not asking for too much 
	Just what I deserve and you said I was the candidate for 
Sherma:
	I can't right now 
Ish:
	What changed so drastically I've been honest from the start with you 
	I've never once made my intentions not clear ....... You stated many times how obvious I was 
	Why dump me..... And how do you not expect me to get really hurt by this?
	Everything you've ever said to me turns into a lie basically for what you did and you wanna be just friends? 
Sherma:
	If I were on the other end I would totally see it the same way 
	But truly I was only thinking of myself, which makes me selfish and not a liar 
Ish:
	Blowing me off Friday makes you a liar
	You also said after Wednesday we'd use the counter next time that's a lie
	Do I need to keep going ?
	Again it's not my reason to chat to throw this in your face ........ I want us to continue
	There is no way you made me think before we hooked up that you would dump me
	So what you mean about making your intentions clear v
	?
	Until you didn't respond to my emails the next day did it ever cross my mind you'd leave me
	Never!!! I thought you were too honest and honorable to be so callous
	Cmon if a guy dumps a girl after a one night stand he's a creep but what are the chances the roles get reversed ???? Almost never 
	It's not like your a young slutty chick or I'm a bad lover just don't make fucken sense
	If it don't make sense it's not true
Sherma:
	I honestly don't know what to say, I'm not a terrible person and I've hurt you. I can't change anything 
Ish:
	Why do I bring out the worse in you.... When I thought I was bringing out your best
Sherma:
	We had a great time together, it was all real to me. I'm not on the best place right now to continue a relationship with you 
Ish:
	When your not in the best place is when I wanna be there the most
	I told you the other day I'm not in best place either and that's why I care even more for you cuz your with me at my worst makes me wanna be better 
	Why can't I be that for you
Sherma:
	Because I do things alone 
Ish:
	Do your things alone .... But you sure didn't seem to mind being with me on our last date or any other time with me for that matter... And we've sent close to a thousand texts to eachother over the last month or so
	I don't feel like I'm bothering you even when you said I was the most annoying person you've ever met
	Are you happier without me?
Sherma:
	You won't see it just yet but I did you a favor. I freed you for someone much more worthy of you 
Ish:
	Not true! Can't I atleast determine that I think you are again underestimating me
	Can you atleast dump me after the real bedding ceremony not the dress rehearsal this time lol!!
	Can we give it to Spring atleast before you break my heart
	See what you did ..... Your cold heart brought in a record cold front this weekend!! Shame on you Sherma
	I wasted 300 bucks on guitar lessons smh
Sherma:
	The next chic will appreciate it 
Ish:
	Shut up
Sherma:
	It's very romantic to be serenaded by a guy 
	Not loss money, good investment 
Ish:
	Shut up
	Are you saying I wasn't romantic?
Sherma:
	You were on point each time 
Ish:
	I can't sing anyway 
Sherma:
	That we both could agree upon 
	No arguments there 
Ish:
	Exactly I'm not serenading shit don't matter if I become carlos Santana
Sherma:
	C'mon be my friend, you could tell me bout your rendezvous 
Ish:
	Nope
	Friends with benefits ?
Sherma:
	Fuck no 
	Be my friend Artie 
Ish:
	Not interested just hurts 
	You said any position any amount of times you owe me!!
	Then I'll think about friendship 
Sherma:
	Someone else would give you the same options 
Ish:
	I don't want someone else just you
	That's the difference between you and me I don't compare and treat you like only you matters you see me as anyone or anybody
	You never gave me my due and apparently never will! Hurts 
	You compare me to your others and I'm not 
Sherma:
	You can't say you walked away with nothing 
	We slept together 
Ish:
	I told you over and over "you ain't seen nothing yet" and you thought I was playing games stroking my ego 
	I told you it's not all talk 
	I walk away a failure hurt with a damaged heart cuz I put faith in a dream that turned into a nightmare 
	I tried to be sober and honest with a person I trusted and they left me cuz I did too good cuz their selfish
	That's worse then nothing! I told you many times it wasn't about sex 
	Reread my posts it's all there !
	You made me feel I was happy to move on from my wife to wish I had her back thx 
	It might've been fun and games for you Sherma but I never planned to intentionally deceive you! You did that to me 
	I even barraged you with arguments to get you to lower the tenth date decree.... Over and over I harassed you to test your fortitude and a few times you asked me to give up on you but not once did you ever ever ever offer to dump me....! So I figured your stubborness was to not quit but make me quit.... Then we have a great week this wee together great sex and then you tap and quit on me out of nowhere!!!!!!!!
	You know how cruel that is and you make it sound like your doing me a favor !!!! Wow
	And do it all thru a cowardly text it's amazing how this whole online dating world is..... People just send a text or ignore you and thinks it's adequate or appropriate !! 
	Fuck your feelings ! It's online dating 
	I know your not that type of person know it in my heart ! In wouldn't of cared about you if You were but everything I just said is the TRUTH and you say the TRUTH is all that matters 
	So what you gonna do now about us ?
	?
Sherma:
	I totally get the anger and if you feel like you need to lash out at me, it's fine. I deserve it. I am capable of hearing the truth and accepting it. I never meant to hurt you but I did. You've share quite intimately your life with me and I've never judged you based on anything. Acceptance and affection was given in return. I can't give you what you want because  not capable of giving it. You don't know me or my life, I internalize my shit. So don't be so quick to judge me 
Ish:
	You were capable every step of way
Sherma:
	Can't talk right now, dropping my daughter off at the station 
Ish:
	And you are capable just do what I want
	Give me another month, we be on a month to month lease don‚Äôt quit!!
	Your not a quitter and some things are worth fighting for
	Insanity is doing the same thing over and over expecting different results‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
Sherma:
	File Transfer: IMG_0661.JPG
	Got this yesterday 
Ish:
	Any particular reason?
Sherma:
	Thought it was appropriate at the time, keep on moving 
Ish:
	Moving from me?
	Can I ask what happened Wednesday that made you decide to tap? Be honest what was it 
	?
Sherma:
	Absolutely nothing , Wednesday was perfect. It was me waking up and realizing that I didn't wanna set myself up and invest any emotional feeling towards you because it will end badly 
Ish:
	But the buildup wasn't subtle ..... You had to have feelings for me before anyway
	Or it would never have happened
	What happen to your willpower and meditation stuff 
Sherma:
	Got flushed 
Ish:
	Why would it end badly we good for eachother
Sherma:
	Could you just be on board with me on this 
Ish:
	You didn't want any commitment anyway
	Give me my night.... You promised 
Sherma:
	I already have you a nite 
	Nothing will change 
Ish:
	I'm like a shark once I get a taste of blood 
	Fine give me the nite then 
Sherma:
	Fuck, just be my friend 
Ish:
	Cmon you promised I was so excited don't do me like this 
	Next Friday! Ok? Then we can talk 
	If you care about me you'll do it 
Sherma:
	You say it's not about Sex for you, yet you keep on pushing to spend the night with me 
Ish:
	It was promised it's about credibility 
Sherma:
	Bullshit 
Ish:
	It will be great won't deny it
	But I don't like being teased and it will help 
	Deal?
Sherma:
	You say you care but in reality you don't 
Ish:
	2 times you stood me up for this 
Sherma:
	You only care about what you may have missed out on 
Ish:
	Nope !
	Ask me that Friday to my face Sherma 
	It's about saying your gonna do something and doing it and yes I want my cake and eat it too after the pain and suffering I've been thorough last few day it's a small very small victory
	Ok? Then we can be something I'll work with you on so we both don't end up hurt and distant from eachother 
	Best offer I'll give ATM... Deal?
	Simple maybe you'll start listening to me...... First you do then you get !
	üëç or üëé
	üôè
Sherma:
	üëé
Ish:
	Really?
Sherma:
	Friendship or nothing 
	And don't be mean 
Ish:
	You really gonna do a power play like this after what you did
	Your the one who's mean
	Has to be a compromise or I will never be able to accept it
Sherma:
	If You care the way you say you do then you would want to keep me in your life 
Ish:
	Nope you dumped me
Sherma:
	I'm offering friendship 
Ish:
	How can I trust you if you don't follow thru on your promise
Sherma:
	So basically we've come to a crossroad , what do you wanna do ?
Ish:
	No crossroad here 
	You changed not me
	You aren't playing fair!
	And for the record,, what are you incapable of giving me that you must hurt me and leave me?
	And go against your word? 
	Even after Wednesday you said it was a good idea and was looking forward to Friday !
	We were good Wednesday it wasn't like Friday was in jeopardy or anything !!!! Total out of left field and out of your character what you did!
	Trust me I've gone over it countless times in my head can't figure it out ! 
	Sooooo Sherma what are u incapable
Of? That you were capable of Wednesday ?
Sherma:
	Wednesday I was swept away, Thursday I had to get my head out of the clouds and keep my feet on the ground 
Ish:
	Lol
Sherma:
	That's the honest truth 
Ish:
	To keep yourself on ground you dump me?
Sherma:
	Yes 
	I didn't dump you, I let you go 
Ish:
	What's wrong with being swept away? Isn't that what we all want
	I did tell you it would happen 
	Told you it wasn't all talk ..... 
Sherma:
	I'm not a teenager, I have to think as an adult 
Ish:
	You even said it would be best ever this did not come out of left field
	So adults dump their lovers after 1 night 
	You said swept away not me you used the teenager words
	It's been a long time for you just infatuation most likely anyway that's why it needs to be done again just to put in in perspective Sherma 
	You made a rash decision on many emotions .... Give it time 
Sherma:
	I'm not disputing your performance, I'm doing what right for me 
	Why are you fighting me on this 
Ish:
	I would be lying if you were the first person to ever come unraveled after 1 of my bedding ceremonies ........ Quite a few times (no lie) my next move has always been to reintroduce myself and start over with the particulipant
	I'm fighting with you cuz I don't agree
	You know friendship wasn't in our deal! 
	Give me Friday night please like you said and then we talk
Sherma:
	Since you're has quite a few there's a non issue of you getting back on the saddle 
	Couldn't be hurt that badly 
Ish:
	We owe it to eachother..... You even said we try out the counter in the herald and you'd treat
	I'm not gonna hold you to that but all nighter yup
	So I'm willing to compromise see I am fair
Sherma:
	If it's about the money then I will reimburse you 
Ish:
	We also have a bet I believe as well more unfinished business 
	It's about honor and truth Sherma ! Then we talk and renegotiate 
	Cmon don't leave me with blue balls again
	We never got to do doggie either 
Sherma:
	This is real life, few are honorable 
Ish:
	I love your backside don't do this to me
	That's what makes us so special that we are honorable 
	And maybe it'll make us wait to when you are capable one day
	But initial contract get fulfilled then we can renegotiate 
Sherma:
	I'm not but I'm trying to do the honorable thing by not getting your hopes up and misleading you 
Ish:
	You already done that 
	Keep it moving u said right 
Sherma:
	Find someone else Artie 
Ish:
	Go forward and only way is to have the event you promised and we built up  
	You are dumping me if you refuse me you understand that 
	Not letting me go..... I wanna stay 
	You are throwing me away and going against your word
	Why is it so hard for you to do what I want? Even when you agreed to it?
Sherma:
	I broke the agreement 
Ish:
	 I know 
Sherma:
	There's no revisiting it 
Ish:
	Says who ?
Sherma:
	Me, Sherma Rayan 
Ish:
	The cowardly lion ?
Sherma:
	Probably 
	I know when to back down 
Ish:
	From poor lil me? What makes me so formidable?
Sherma:
	Your persistence 
Ish:
	You kept a kissing me you were the more persistent one 
	Lion and tiger came out lol!! I liked it
Sherma:
	It's not difficult  for you to move forward, only your ego is hurt 
	Find someone new 
Ish:
	It's not that another reason why you need to do what's promised then you can see it
	See and feel my pain
	Why you still think I'm all talk is beyond me 
	Again , what are you incapable of after Wednesday? And why you dump me for ? I need to know this
	How did the great Sherma the bull become incapable or impotent?
	All the shit talk and you fizzle like this ? I need to know plz if you gonna send me away be honest
	?
Sherma:
	Sorry, FT with my daughter 
	I wasn't bullshiting when I told you that I don't wanna be in love 
	You laughed at me when I told you that 
Ish:
	Don't remember that
Sherma:
	It's the reason I let go, whenever I feel like I'm getting to close I pulled away 
	It's nothing you did , it's all me 
Ish:
	But I asked you if this would be a one night stand and you said no
	What did you think best ever meant?
Sherma:
	Chris didn't buy the fact that I let him go becuz I was falling for him, he thought I use him to get over my husband 
Ish:
	You never told me why you dumped Chris
	Is Chris the nurse or Dr?
Sherma:
	I was in love with him and I didn't want to take the risk of getting hurt and I let him go 
	Chris is the Dr 
Ish:
	He moved though 
	And you went on a plane to be with him 
	Please !! This is not the same don't fool yourself 
	Not even close lol
	In August you went on plane to be with him .......... 
	I don't even wanna revisit the past can't we talk about us
	That's has nothing to do with us! You might think it does but nope it don't
	Not buying it! 
	You dumped the dr anyway cuz the guy is 3k miles away and you chose your daughters u said 
	And your not even divorced that's not practical 
	He got 4 months of you I got not even 4 weeks
	No comparison ...... 
Sherma:
	Will it be better if you dump me ??
Ish:
	Will it get me my full night with you?
Sherma:
	Will you carry less resentment for me ?
Ish:
	I won't dump you 
	My heart is strong enough for both of us
Sherma:
	Stop with the bs 
Ish:
	I'm not full of bs - when are you gonna realize that 
Sherma:
	You're disappointed and slightly hurt that I let you go
Ish:
	Tell yourself that so you can look in mirror
	I will show you next date there will be no arguments then 
	1 night in Sherma - next Friday ok?
Sherma:
	No my twin, it's a drunk saying this is his last drink. Doesn't work like that 
Ish:
	We are not twins ! My twin and my lady died yesterday 
Sherma:
	I deserve that 
Ish:
	For who me or you? Who's the drunk in your metaphor?
Sherma:
	You, wanting to spend one nite with me and thinking that it's all good and you can walk away 
Ish:
	I said we renegotiate? That's it nothing about walking away.  If I don't like the deal then I'll walk 
Sherma:
	Do you knowing it wasn't about sex, you would have said, I want to see you just to talk 
	But everything leads back to bedding ceremony 
Ish:
	Look in the mirror! That's you not me ! I didn't walk out after bedding ceremony you did!
Sherma:
	By no means I'm I testing you, just stating the facts as I see it 
	Let's call a spade a space 
Ish:
	My dead lady dis honored me 
	Your the spade not me
	I didn't go anywhere I didn't break my oath!
	I'm the real deal just as advertised 
	I never broke your heart
	Did you dump the Dr after first time you fucked him?
	No you went on a plane to give him even more 
Sherma:
	I didn't break your heart, I broke a date 
Ish:
	Please just don't question my motives they are always pure with you always were always will be
Sherma:
	Let's not confuse your heart with your genitals 
Ish:
	You dumped me and damaged my heart correct
	Tapped out quit on us
	What's a matter with u..... Why u minimizing my feelings and your actions the other day
	You confused them not me! When it comes to you they are intertwined 
	You think we just fucked Wednesday? It was all about genitals?
Sherma:
	What was it for you ?
Ish:
	Does it matter?
	All that matters what you thought your the one who ended it 
	You didn't even wanna discuss it all you wanted was to push me away to the other end of the universe good job!!
	You didn't even wanna talk during the bedding ceremony, during train trip (very long train ride) or the next day 
	You broke 
	Mission accomplished !!
Sherma:
	I despised that term " bedding ceremony "
Ish:
	When we lord and lady it was appropriate 
Sherma:
	Just hate me and move in 
Ish:
	You even said it was ill show you the post 
	I'll never hate you 
	I don't work like that
	I'm not gonna stoop to your level either 
Sherma:
	Okay , say goodbye Sherma, can't say it was a pleasure knowing you 
Ish:
	You owe me Sherma ! You owe yourself what was promised 
	Then we negotiate!
Sherma:
	But I (Artie ) deserve better 
Ish:
	Have I ever been wrong about anything about us?
	Don't flake out like this 
Sherma:
	I want you to walk away and be okay 
Ish:
	Don't make too much good or bad about 1 night 
	I'm not okay
	We on for Friday ? Full night no few hours bs
Sherma:

Ish:
	Fine is that a yes?
Sherma:
	Why do you wanna do this to yourself 
Ish:
	Do what ?
Sherma:
	You don't gently pull on a bandaid 
	You pull it right off 
	Swiftly 
Ish:

	I'm hurt but I'm not stupid
	I know what I'm doing 
	Deal?
Sherma:
	I will let you know 
	No talking or texting for a week and if you feel the same let me know on Friday 
Ish:
	I will feel the same 
	So it's a definite?
Sherma:
	No it's not 
Ish:
	You might get period?
Sherma:
	Tell me what you have to say now, I'll decide if it makes sense

Ish:
	Yes you did why are you reminding me?
	What's your point ?
Sherma:
	Youre not entitle to having a rendezvous 
	Unless we're friends with benefits and you clearly stated you don't wanna be friends 
Ish:
	Are you saying no now to Friday? Going back against your word 
	You clearly stated you don't wanna be friends with benefits 
Sherma:
	How could I say no when I didn't say yes to Friday 
	I'm tired 
	I need to sleep 
Ish:
	You kept it open 
	Say yes to me and then I'll let you sleep
Sherma:
	You were talking, I was listening 
Ish:
	Then you can be my valentine in 19 minutes
	Don't say the h word
Sherma:
	What's the "h" word 
Ish:
	That you h#te Valentine's Day
Sherma:

Sherma:

	Let me go to bed 
Ish:

	Beside their are a few more answers I need before I close the book 
Sherma:

Ish:
	But I do have some other questions in meantime ok?

	I'm still bitter and hurt it'll take a while to get over 
	Anyway ready for some questions?
Sherma:

Ish:
	When did you decide to get your knew tattoo?
Sherma:

Ish:
	Thx
	Means a lot
	Will you ever be capable to give me what I want?
Sherma:
	I don't think I have it within me 
Ish:
	Can we try a lil longer maybe a month?
	You were doing really good until yesterday
	I'll do better at respecting your space and boundaries this month
	I didn't realize how fragile you were
Sherma:
	What's the next question ?
Ish:
	Not gonna answer?
Sherma:
	5th
Ish:
	You mentioned friends with benefits? Is that an option?
Sherma:
	No it's not 
	Why can't we cool where if I ask you to come out to the city and catch a movie, you're okay with it 
	I can be friends with a man and not sleep with them 
Ish:
	Do you ever listens to me...... I despise restrictions 
	I like to fly remember not wings clipped I loved ur description about clouds 
	The first few dates with you were torture for me lol! Last date was just starting to open up and you closed door unfortunately
Sherma:
	You sent me a thousand text, that's not opening up, smh
Ish:
	Now that I'm dumped and your moving forward are you gonna start dating other guys on tinder and such?
	The texts and stuff were awesome and for you more or less to get comfortable enough for Wednesday it was foreplay I always said you ain't see nothing yet
Sherma:
	I have no interest in seeing anyone on tinder or any other site 
Ish:
	Basically they were to guard against what happened anyway 
	And I'm also alone pretty much as well 
Sherma:
	I had 126 matches 
Ish:
	It was nice ..... But I'm not a platonic guy sorry 
	Rather be alone then teased
Sherma:
	Yes 
	Got work and my children to keep me busy 
	I'm okay with it 
Ish:
	I need a job smh can you just stay with me until then?
	1 more month then go on your run ?
	Your leaving me almost worse off then you found me?
Sherma:
	Liar 
	You said I made you better 
Ish:
	You did until you dumped me
	Now I'm more depressed basically 
Sherma:
	Shut up 
	You're gonna let a lil Indian girl depress ur ?
Ish:
	I got hurt by another on liner in October that lasted like a month you're worse so it's gonna be atleast a few months to get over
	Can you make love to me for a few more months 
	Beside this Friday ofcourse 
	One more month my rules this time ok? 
	You'll fall out of love with me Most likely anyway
Sherma:
	I'm not sexy deprived woman that would eagerly jump in bed with you 
	Sexy =sex
Ish:
	I'm sex deprived do it for me
	Ok?
	You said you hadn't had sex since August that's sex deprived hellooooo
Sherma:
	I could fuck anyone at work, including my best friend but I chose not too
Ish:
	Don't say you weren't into it on Wednesday 
	Were u being honest about August ?
	Tell me truth ?
Sherma:
	Completely honest 
Ish:
	Are you admitting you can't handle me?
Sherma:
	 Not saying that, just don't want you to get the idea that I am the kind of woman who needs a man 
Ish:
	Again I'm not a man why you generalize so much 
	Can you handle Artie? 
Sherma:
	I did, didn't I ?
Ish:
	Hell no you tapped
	Said nothing was Gonna happen either remember?
	Stuff happened and I'm hurt deeply cuz of it
	I wish it never happened if I thought I was gonna lose my lady for it would've stayed home 
	You are so tone deaf really in all this 
	That's one of the main reasons I want Friday to happen 
Sherma:
	So why don't you explain it better 
	?
Ish:
	Why? You left me 
	It don't matter if your incapable of loving me
	Why make it worse for you ....... I'm a good guy
	Everything i did was with great care of you 
	It blew up in my face
	Lost my partner 
	So just admit it .... You couldn't handle me 
	Be honest !
	Talk is over the relationship is over 
Sherma:
	Handle you ?? I handle you just fine 
	Shish 
Ish:
	You tapped! 
Sherma:
	Let me finish 
	I will say that you put a lot of thought into the dates 
	And I enjoyed your company each time 
Ish:
	And?
	Continue 
Sherma:
	Didn't I say shish 
Ish:
	Yup
Sherma:
	Okay 
	Thank you 
	You were fun and a lot of the times unpredictable 
	Challenging yet rewarding 
	Honestly you were great
	I felt myself getting to close and yea probably you could say I couldn't handle you and I decided to walk away 
	Floor is yours 
Ish:
	How good was the sex?
Sherma:
	That's all you got from what I said 
Ish:
	I was with you during all this 
	The only time you ever shut up (very suprisingly I must say) was when we were doing it 
	So yes all the other info was nice to hear but it's not any news flash
Sherma:
	I'm not a big talker to start with 
Ish:
	How good was the sex?
Sherma:
	Basically you're just want me to rate your performance ?
	And not you as a person ? 
	Something is wrong with you 
Ish:
	I want you to answer the question 
	Please
	You there?
Sherma:
	You were very good in bed 
Ish:
	The best?
Sherma:
	Why? What's so important in knowing whether you're the best or not ?
	I thought my husband was the best I've ever had 
Ish:
	You dumped me after hello
	I held back and only had 2 hours 
Sherma:
	I thought Chris was better than my husband 
	I thought you were far better than my friend 
	The nurse 
Ish:
	Soooo
	But the dr. And your husband were better?
Sherma:
	Don't do this 
Ish:
	You fucken brought them up not me
	I just asked if I was the best
	You did this and please answer thx
	But the dr. And your husband were better?
	Correct?
Sherma:
	This is not productive 
Ish:
	It is for me trust me please be honest
	You started and I'm glad in a way you did thx
Sherma:
	They were because I spent more time with them 
Ish:
	Why don't i have that opportunity?
Sherma:
	Because I can't focus on you right now 
	I have too much shit going on in my life 
Ish:
	I'm not asking for your focus just on what was promised 
	We then can renegotie!!!!
	Renegotiate 
	You are not being honest with me
Sherma:
	You're so fucking fixated on sex negotiations 
	I am honest with you 
Ish:
	Not at all! Apparently it wasn't all that good
Sherma:
	You refuse to believe me 
Ish:
	You said they were better so it's not being sexual with me that's the problem
	Yet you dump me after sex what I'm supposed to think 
	You realize you dumped me after fucking me 
	You made it about sex not me
	It was business as usual for me after I was very happy and comfortable with our relationship 
	I'm not about sex I didn't leave you ! 
	Now I find out others were better so this whole clouds thing doesn't hold water with me 
Sherma:
	Apparently I'm the worse fucking person, so why you trying to get with me 
Ish:
	I want to understand 
	My mind and heart are very connected that's why I'm very good at this shit helloooo
	I'm a pure simple person whose in control with his feeling and stuff and this walking out by you threw me for a loop
	I can't wrap my head around it! I started to but there's more your not telling me obviously 
	You were in good hands with me believe it or not .....
Sherma:
	It's that you're so much in control that me walking away leaves you in a limbo. You don't know what to donor how to feel 
	And a million questions followed 
Ish:
	No one in there right mind walks away from someone after sex especially a woman
Sherma:
	So great one , what do you think it is ?? 
Ish:
	Don't figure me out please if you wanna know just ask I'll tell u
Sherma:
	Enlighten me , cuz I'm missing that piece of the puzzle 
Ish:
	I wanna the same opportunity as the Dr! If he was a better lover then me and you loved him more why can't I get the same opportunity I'm in the same fucken state too
	Wanna = want
Sherma:
	I didn't love him becuz he was a better lover, but because I was in love with him 
	It wasn't based on performance 
Ish:
	Fine ...... I didn't say it was
	Why can't I get same opportunity? Why I only get weeks
	Did you dump the dr after fucking him ?
	Is this your MO?
	Nurse guy too?
	Please be honest I need to know this 
	I've never been dumped like this 
	Still there ?
Sherma:
	Yea
Ish:
	Ok u gonna give me some clarity plz
	And please don't bring up sex and me u dumped me you made it the issue 
	I pushed for Wednesday to enhance Friday not lose it smh
	I don't think you grasp what it's like and how embrrassing it is to get dumped be a girl the day after you 1st have sex
	And on top of it to hear how her last lover was better
	Are you kidding me ? Lol floors yours I'll stay away from sharp objects 
Sherma:
	Artie, you were an amazing lover, I was pleasured the moment you started kissing me 
	You lack nothing in bed and not for one sec did I think you were inadequate 
	You Penis was happy to respond to my body 
	And I enjoyed you completely 
	It is my own shit that made me walk away 
	Noticing to do with you, I promise 
	Nothing 
Ish:
	Don't believe it!
	The sex change our relationship it ended it
Sherma:
	If you stop and listen you might actually hear me 
Ish:
	I'm not talking about the act I was there 
Sherma:
	STOP !!!
	The cockiness gets me 
	I'm being honest and you can't even acknowledge it 
Ish:
	I know about that ! But the after effect is what ended us ! You said the cloud thing and all
Sherma:
	What's the point if we're just going in circles 
Ish:
	The dr obviously sent you to clouds as well correct?
	Your not a liar or a dishonest person why become that after Wednesday and walk from me and go against our plans for Friday?
Sherma:
	Are you seriously jealous of someone that's not even here 
Ish:
	Yup
	He got 4 months I got 4 weeks 
	If he was in NY he probably have had longer
	You can tell me the truth! Why I get less
Sherma:
	No explanation or reason would be adequate enough 
Ish:
	For me it would
	I like to know the reasons helps me move on 
Sherma:
	No, you'll find a reason to discredit it 
Ish:
	Doesn't make pain go away 
	If it's truth can't be discredited
Sherma:
	Everything I've told you this far has been the truth 
	And I probably did not live up to all the things I promised 
Ish:
	Nope 
	But you gonna correct?
Sherma:
	What the fuck do you want from me ?
Ish:
	Want u back
	Truthfully I'm hurt and want you back I like is 
	Is = us
	I think all the other lovers better stuff is total nonsense
	Don't believe it for a second! 
	And in answer to your question is simple ! I don't want you to go! And all the other stuff is just me deciphering what you want and how you feel
	I can't see you so I have to feel you out and ask around 
	I don't wanna see you unless it is on my terms in private cuz it'll be very emotional for both of us
	We back? Makeup Friday? And u give me what we both want deal?
	Any deal can be rescinded legally in 72hours called buyers remorse 
	üëç or üëé
	üôè
Sherma:
	Sorry my eyelids shit for a bit 
	Had to read 
	The correct term is caveat emptor 
	I was in real estate 
	Know my terminology quite well 
Ish:
	Caveat emptor is buyer beware 
Sherma:
	That's for you 
Ish:
	Nothing to do with rescind order anyway
	I was a mortgage broker for a year 
	Anyway don't stall please 
Sherma:
	I was also a broker for 3 yrs....Nothing is gonna change but I will give you the day I promise 
Ish:
	Friday we gonna do it again and talk?
Sherma:
	I will give you Friday 
Ish:
	In a room? 
	All night ?
Sherma:
	Not sure about the all nite 
Ish:
	No deal !Can we just act like yesterday never happened then?
	All nite like you said ! I'm not going in there to fight 
	It will be love, honor and respect 
	Then If you walk I'll never bother you again
	No resentment 
	No bad blood No hard feelings 
	I won't even rip trini girls
Sherma:
	So why is it so difficult for you to let me walk away now ?
Ish:
	Unfinished business
	I don't want you to walk 
	I feel cheated and betrayed won't feel that after a whole night with u plus I'll never forgive myself if I don't do you doggie and I have my favorite position (a surprise) I wanna show you 
	Full penetration lol!!! Very comfortable too 
Sherma:
	I'm good, no thanks 
Ish:
	Not gonna do Friday?
	No thanks to what ?
Sherma:
	Doggie 
Ish:
	Why not? You have such a soft behind I love it
	And the beautiful tattoo
	It's perfect 
	Give me just 1 crack before you ride into the sunset please???
	I've imagined it ever you said the 10th decree 
	Sent me the pic I'm wanting you badly that way telling you I used a lot of restraint Wednesday believe it or not 
	It was very sensual Wednesday wouldn't trade it for the world except you left me for it 
	Otherwise it was perfect for its intended purpose as a test run ! 
	But I'll never forgive myself unless we have Friday ! 
	To lose you this way hurts like you can never imagine this was tough real tough to accept for me 
	I would love to say I have no regrets but I can't and all I see is regrets that's why Friday will help with closure
	All systems go Friday? We back together until then ok
	Or we breakup and vow of silence til then?
	Eyes open?
	üëÄ
	Hi! Lion roaring today or still purring?

Sherma:
	Yup
Ish:
	Great! I‚Äôm glad

Sherma:
	Yea 
	Not sure if I can do the all nite thing tho 
	Based on the price cuz I wanna get a new phone 
Ish:
	I‚Äôll pay
	Don‚Äôt worry about the money‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. You showing up is payment enough really appreciate this, so it‚Äôs in stone? No backing out correct?
Sherma:
	I'll be there 
Ish:

Sherma:
	I'm yours for the nite 
Ish:
	Thanks‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. now that‚Äôs official can we please talk about some other stuff

Sherma:

	G2G
	I'll text you when I'm done 
	In the middle of something 
Ish:
	Ok
Sherma:
	Hey 
Ish:
	hey
Sherma:
	I'm ready for the questions 
Ish:
	you felling better
	feeling
Sherma:
	Yup 
	Go for it 
Ish:
	Did you read the stuff I said before you fell out‚Ä¶ any comments on it
Sherma:
	Skim thru
	Let me go back 
	What pic you're referring too ?
	And yea read it 
Ish:
	The back shot pic what else lol
	Now that we on for Friday and talking a bit any chance we can rethink our status and not call it a breakup but just a break maybe
Sherma:
	Could we like not think ahead and just do Friday 
Ish:
	Fine with me 
	So your not officially tapping yet correct 
Sherma:
	I'll give you limited time to get your feet off the ground 
	Don't get excited and thank me 
	Don't wanna leave you in a worse off position 
Ish:
	Ok..... Very fair I went back last nite and reread all out posts 
	Out = our .... You did make some references to  last few relationships about pushing away and letting go and stuff
	But when I pushed you on it you kinda backed off a bit and didn't elaborate much ..... You think it's a good idea on Friday to spend time together going over our conversations and reminiscence a bit so we totally can understand eachother?
	I have all our texts on my laptop lol 
	I plan on bringing it 
	Good idea?
Sherma:
	I'm sure you would remember everything completely 
Ish:
	We can remember it together and laugh about it that's whole point 
	And you'd be surprised how a comma here or period there can change the whole context of a text
	Ok? I think it'll be therapeutic for both of us
Sherma:
	Or we could just lay quietly next to each other 
Ish:
	That's what supposed to happen after the act my lady lol
	You weren't into quiet on Wednesday lol
	You had a lil pep in your step to be honest it had been a while for you totally understandable 
	For me too.... But you a lil longer 
	All good no complaints other then tapping two days later üò©
	Can I still call you my lady?
Sherma:
	You gave it up 2 days ago 
	Don't wanna be your lady in rebound 
Ish:
	You giving me what I want now and still talking with me with an open mind things aren't always in stone they can change 
	Does it bother you is what I'm asking?
Sherma:
	I don't want you to keep looking to the future and miss out on the now 
	This right now is what matters
Ish:
	How do you know what I'm looking at lol
	I've done a lot of thinking and have decided to change some things with us implementing some new Sherma rules lol
Sherma:
	You look towards a future and I stay in the present 
	If you do the thinking for me sir, there's no point in me having a brain of my own 
	Maybe I've never mention this to you, it may or may not have been important but I don't plan ahead for a glorious future, with sunshine and stars 
	If today is all I got then I'm grateful and thankful that it did happen 
Ish:
	Ok
	Sooo then can you now admit that I fucked your brains out and now your starting to find them?
Sherma:
	It was never lost just misplaced 
Ish:
	Understood I'm seeing that
	Over the years what you haven't seen from me yet but will now after Friday ! Is I'm very good and very experienced at damage control ..... And since we are talking and I'm understanding more the crisis at hand I'd like to bounce some new ideas off ya ok?
Sherma:
	You'ld be bouncing against titanium , just saying 
Ish:
	 What does that mean
	The same titanium that said nothing would happen on Wednesday?
Sherma:
	Go for it 
	Bouncing away 
Ish:
	I'll drop my persistence to 0...... Good idea or bad idea? 
Sherma:
	Great idea 
Ish:
	See that who knew I might not be just an idiot
Sherma:
	Not me :)
Ish:
	No more building things up or flirting either ..... Friday is another day no reason anymore to stir the pot 
Sherma:
	Flirting ?? Who does that ?
	And further explain building up things 
Ish:
	I always flirt with you sexual innuendo and stuff when we go over our texts all you will see is flirting 
	Fotc? Best ever , you can't handle me , that's buildup talking shit 
	No more ego 
Sherma:
	Perfect 
Ish:
	Im not after your heart anymore if when it becomes vulnerable you break 
	We will simplify things I figure we will spend time Friday.... Basically both take a vacation from our lives and if you feel up to it maybe do it again in March a few weeks ... In between you can text me and I'll answer very matter of factly business like.....
	Give you time to collect yourself and wade threw all your feelings and not focus on just 1 thing
	I have no problem taking a back seat if it will keep you sane
	Also rereading some of your past posts two big things about you scream out.  1. You don't trust men and 2. You worry about me sticking around 
	Soooo if I stick around in the background even for a while maybe it'll help remedy those two issues 
	Good idea ?
Sherma:
	Surprisingly I agree with almost everything you've said 
Ish:
	Why am I still suprising you? 
	I figure I'll be there if you need me but not there all the time and in return every few weeks you give me a nite ok?
	We will call it Forbidden love! 
	Ok?
Sherma:
	Sounds like something I could possibly work it 
Ish:
	Ok ..... I'm not gonna push anymore you want me to go now? Have any questions for me?
Sherma:
	No questions just a comment 
	Can you not drink as much when we're together
Ish:
	Yup not a problem ! 
	Only had two big ones and 1 bottle on the train lol! 
Sherma:
	That's a lot for me 
	Not use to having people drink around me 
Ish:
	But due to my lower tolerance from lack of drinking it did make me babble a bit 
	You ask you get! I won't drink at all Friday .... If you wanna have 1 social one at a nice bar or restaurant I will oblige
	Other then that I'll drink water 
	Or Gatorade in the room
	Anything else?
Sherma:
	Can't think of anything at this time 
Ish:
	Then enjoy your day and if you think of anything you know how to reach me üòò
Sherma:
	You don't have to go 
Ish:
	Ok 
	I don't have much to say don't wanna ruin anything 
Sherma:
	You don't have much to say ??? 
	That's a first 
Ish:
	Actually I will say this...... Don't feel the need to internalize things you can vent on me 
Sherma:
	This post I should screen shot 
Ish:
	Tell me anything I will try not to judge you or criticize 
Sherma:
	What do you wanna know 
	Today is a bit difficult for me, lost my baby 3 yrs ago on Valentine's Day 
	Had a miscarriage 
Ish:
	Ouch 
	How many months did you carry the baby?
Sherma:
	5 months
Ish:
	Damn you were gonna have a child pretty late almost a miracle you got pregnant
Sherma:
	My mom had my last sister at 50... Now you have a clearer pic of why I don't celebrate V day any longer 
Ish:
	Me and my ex tried real hard to have another child did two cycles of in vitro never happened hurt us both deeply 
	They say the older a woman gets the lower quality eggs are..... Who the F knows 
	But it definitely played a factor in our demise ..... Oh well 
Sherma:
	This pregnancy wasn't planned, came right after I found out about the affair 
	But I wanted this baby more than anything else 
Ish:
	Why so badly? Maternal instincts kicking in or more political?
Sherma:
	Maternal, I'm not materialistic 
	Don't give a fuck about money or status 
Ish:
	I never said anything about money or material where that come from
	Political = to get maybe your husband back or let the other woman know if he says he's not sleeping with me he's lying to U too 
	That's political things nothing about money 
Sherma:
	Didn't want him back under any circumstances 
	Once trust is broken the marriage is over 
	I don't do 2nd chances 
Ish:
	What am I?
	Sorry was that out of bounds?
Sherma:
	A promise I'm bonded by 
	Don't wanna snap at you 
	So I'm gonna keep it about me today 
Ish:
	Ok
Sherma:
	You don't know about my life 
	Just briefing you 
Ish:
	Keep it coming very interesting 
	I
Also appreciate the honesty and trust 
Sherma:
	I loved my husband completely, the kindda of love teenagers feel for each other 
	Not just loved him but was in love with him 
	He broke me and destroyed our children 
	That's something I will
Never be able to forgive. You duck with my children I will take you down and make sure you on your knees 
Ish:
	Was the affair the big thing or just a culmination of stuff
Sherma:
	I don't play when it comes to my daughters 
	It came out from nowhere, I had zero idea 
	So it was like a ton of bricks crashing down at the same time 
	Couldn't handle it and I fell apart 
Ish:
	So then he was still giving you what you wanted ..... Just had a mistress it sounds like.... Not at all minimizing his actions 
	But he wasn't a bad person at home it sounds like it could've been worse no domestic violence like you homegirl or nothing 
	Was he there for his daughters ?
Sherma:
	He was the best father and husband 
	But it all went to shit after the affair 
Ish:
	Then you might need to forgive him for yourself 
	Just saying ...... 
	And for your daughters 
	I believe a man can love two women 
Sherma:
	I do not believe in infidelity , would never put myself in a situation like that 
Ish:
	It's not fair to you but if my wife had an affair and was good to me I wouldn't hold a grudge 
	It would hurt at first a great deal but if she's a good mother to my son that's more important then being a good wife
	And if I love her ...... Her happiness is more important then mine
	And if she was happier with another person I'd give her my blessing
Sherma:
	He broke the circle of trust, nothing you can say would change the facts 
Ish:
	No argument there but he didn't think he'd get caught apparently 
Sherma:
	We all have choices to make, some more difficult than others but at the end of the day, family comes first 
Ish:
	How long did his affair go on for?
Sherma:
	To presently 
Ish:
	When did it start?
Sherma:
	3 yrs ago 
Ish:
	Is she much younger ?
Sherma:
	Yup 
Ish:
	How did you catch him?
Sherma:
	She sent me an email while I was on my  vacation on our anniversary 
	My daughter open the email because she was doing a web checking for me 
	She didn't say anything to me about it and I saw it when I got back 
	Technically they found out before I did 
Ish:
	She played dirty and apparently got her man all fair in love and war they say 
Sherma:
	From then it was a downward spiral for the entire family after he confirmed it was just a one time thing 
Ish:
	It sucks no doubt be he got doubt crossed by her
	It wasn't a 1 time thing if he still with her correct?
	Or do you feel you pushed him into her arms?
Sherma:
	It doesn't matter where it came from, rather have my head above sand than to be buried by it 
Ish:
	If it was a 1 time thing you should've considered forgiving him if he still wanted you
Sherma:
	It's much as i loved him I won't take him back 
Ish:
	I'd forgive my wife if I lover her and she cheated my ego doesn't trump my heart
	I'd put her out for a lil bit if I could and make her eat crow for a while but after that I'd be back 
	I melt when I see a woman I care about cry 
Sherma:
	I'm not made up like that, you fuck up, you leave  
Ish:
	No ones perfect and beautiful woman is a hard thing to refuse in a moment of weakness why I don't talk to them unless I'm dtf
	Apparently you aren't like that if you can't get over it and push guys away 
Sherma:
	Thats the reason I became who I am 
	I will never show weakness 
Ish:
	Well your thinking is off ... If you can't be whole again you need to forgive this dude and be friends again 
	I know it's tough but you need to do it for yourself and talk with him you'll be suprised how well it goes 
	He might even want you back 
Sherma:
	I DONT EVER want him back 
Ish:
	You don't need to take him back but you'll feel much better about it 
	Might even laugh about it
Sherma:
	Nah I'm good 
Ish:
	No your not
Sherma:
	I am 
Ish:
	Nope
	Good people don't run from people they care about lol
	I'm just playing devils advocate a bit but it is eating you up inside apparently and talking about it is awesome and therapeutic 
Sherma:
	I've been to therapy 
Ish:
	Looking at it from a total non objective view understand that 
	I'm not trying to tell you anything to benefit myself understand that
	I'm telling you this cuz it'll benefit your family 
	Which will benefit you
	IMHO a person shouldn't be punished cuz I love them ...... Especially when it doesn't work out you said yourself no reason to throw things in someone face ..... So forgive this dude he knows he fucked up and give him a chance to make amends with his daughters 
	You said yourself how precious a daughter loves their dad and how I'm even missing that .... Why should he lose out on that he did give you many good years 
	Clearly the good outweighs the bad in this case 
Sherma:
	I will never put up a road block bet him and the girls, I'm not petty. He have to work it out with them am done mediating 
Ish:
	Do you encourage your daughters to see their father
	Your not petty are you kidding me!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Sherma:
	Yes and make sure they send him cards and thank you notes 
Ish:
	Your CAPS writing about not wanting him back ( not to mention Friday shhhh) is clear proof your not over him 
	Need to pick n choose your battles 
Sherma:
	I don't want him back, ever 
	You don't know how stubborn I am 
	When my mind is made up, I'm done 
Ish:
	I have an idea please
	Stubborn isn't appropriate here wrong action sorry
	If you love someone it's unconditional 
	Or it's about power and control not love 
Sherma:
	That's bullshit 
Ish:
	Your the bull not me
	Stubborn can be a strength but it can also be a weakness 
	Why are you being stubborn about exactly toward him ? Not taking him back ? Not loving him ? Not forgiving him ? 
	Where is this "you don't know how stubborn I am originate from" ?
Sherma:
	Meaning that once my mind is made up, I don't look back 
Ish:
	Bullshit 
	If that was the case you'd be capable of loving again and loving even better 
	Not all broke and nuts and insane lol
Sherma:
	I was actually referring to my daughters father 
Ish:
	I know 
Sherma:
	I loved him once 
	I will be thankful for the good years 
	But I will never take him back 
Ish:
	All this is about your husband I know who did you think I was calling bullsjhit on 
	Cuz of him and your refusal to get over it you claim to be incapable of love that's something you need to explore with your relationship with him and I think forgive him ..... Play nice and be great friends 
	There's obviously still a void there 
	You feel betrayed when it reality it's not your fault and ultimately should be ok with it 
	His loss not yours and make someone else happy maybe some cute great funny guy named Artie or something 
	Sorry first name popped in my head 
Sherma:
	I'm sure 
Ish:
	Sorry no motive there üòú
	Honestly maybe a small one I'm not perfect ok 
	But the point still stands 
Sherma:
	I totally get what you're saying 
	We as a daily been they counseling and therapy for over a year 
	Daily =Family 
	There's my life in a nut shell 
	( coconut )
	Harder to crack 
Ish:
	Thanks for sharing 
	Please take what I said with a grain of salt I'm done pushing will try not to mention anymore unless of course U want to
Sherma:
	K 
	I know you meant well, thank you 
Ish:
	YW my pleasure 
Sherma:
	Are you going over to spend time with your son today ?
Ish:
	Nope saw him Friday 
Sherma:

Ish:

Sherma:

Ish:

Sherma:

	When I grow up amma be just like you :)
Ish:
	üôè
Sherma:
	Pigs may fly 1st tho 
	We could be such good friends if you only give it a chance 
	We could look back at this time and laugh 
	I could give you advice on females and help you screen them 
Ish:
	My compass is fine no thx
	Don't need any female friends sorry I'll play nice but if you keep persisting I might have to persist back 
Sherma:
	You're turning me down .. Smh
Ish:
	We can agree to disagree on our definition of friends 
Sherma:
	Every man deserves to have a best friend thats female 
Ish:
	I agree their lover 
Sherma:
	Whatever 
	Can't say I didn't try to be your friend 
Ish:

Sherma:

Ish:
	Is that not the pot calling the kettle black 
Sherma:
	Yea I know am a  fuck up 
Ish:
	Yup
	I will keep my faith ..... It's a huge risk but no risk no reward 
	Maybe you bounce back maybe you don't! I'll stick around 
	Have I ever told you my greatest super power ?
Sherma:
	No u haven't 
Ish:
	I'm a chameleon 
Sherma:
	Sounds familiar 
Ish:
	I can adapt and fit in almost any situation 
Sherma:
	Did mention it before 
Ish:
	Yes i went hard at you but I wanted you to fall head over heels .... They say be careful what you wish for ..... You are living proof of that ........ Unfortunately you couldn't handle it...... So ill improvise adapt and overcome .....
	Friday is our next obstacle ........ I'll try to keep you from unraveling until then and afterwards and on to march ok?
	?
	File Transfer: IMG_1097.JPG
	Wtf?
Sherma:
	Am here
	You wanted me to fall head over heels ?
	Did you ever think it would happen to you in the process ?

	Bedtime 
Ish:
	Please cAreful with word tap?
	What are you saying ? 
	I'm not head over heels what are u saying Sherma? 
Sherma:
	I was not implying that you are 
	Just asking ?
Ish:
	I'm hurt and care much but I'm not anywhere near head over heels like I said you ain't seen nothing yet
	You quit when the fun was just starting !!! I'm a loving person period 
	Do I love you..... I really couldn't say yet idk .... But for me to be in love I need to see more of you no restrictions  
	Not just you anyone! I'm too mature and wise too fall in love overnight 
	Been in love know it all too well and I want it back but searching is a lot of fun and you are capable regardless what you say just a pussy ATM but not only do I see potential in you I've even felt it!
	Are you in love with me Sherma?
Sherma:
	Previously stated, I'm incapable
Ish:
	I don't believe that 
	If you were incapable you wouldn't have tapped last week
	Nope it was just opposite 
	It smells a lot better then any cologne admit it? I know you smell it 
Sherma:
	I have sinus congestion at the moment 
Ish:
	Lol! Ok that was funny 
Sherma:
	Can't smell anything 
Ish:
	I'll give you that one 
	I got my answer...... Shouldn't have tapped maybe I'd have said it back 
Sherma:
	I didn't say anything 
Ish:
	GN get some sleep I said I'd back off and I meant it!!! Didn't have to say it!
	Actions speak louder then words 
	You broke ! Not me ! We will get you back it's a marathon remember that not a sprint just don't quit again 
	Wasn't such a bad day all things considered agree?
Sherma:
	Pretty good 
Ish:

Sherma:
	It functions only as a muscle 
Ish:

Ish:

	My day was nice! Loving this rain wishing the snow away
	Washing 
	Very true I agree "head was in clouds before heart I'm sure" .....
Sherma:

	And I go to bed earlier on a Wednesday 
Ish:
	Understood just a question thx for answering 
	You said earlier that "i enjoy being with you" ---  is that only meant now in a "friendly" sense?
Sherma:
	If that were the case I won't be seeing you on Friday  
Ish:
	Thx üëç
Sherma:

Sherma:

Ish:
	Really‚Ä¶
	Sounds like your back alright lol!  these shady answers again omg!!
	I did but I didn‚Äôt wishy washy stuff your sooooo good at
Sherma:
	We had conversations regarding my personal life's
	Life 
Ish:
	My lady is too cute
Sherma:
	So yea it was good 
Ish:
	Yes we did‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ it was nice I said I wouldn‚Äôt bring it up 
	So Can I persist again these next few days or you still want me to be 2nd fiddle background guy still
Sherma:
	You didn't refer to me as your lady but listen 
	Which was nice 
Ish:
	You h@te the word ‚Äúlist$n‚Äù why you using it on me now
Sherma:
	Different context 
Ish:
	I can listen , I can be whatever you want me to be
	Give me what I want and I‚Äôll give you what you want
	Thats why I say in my bio - ‚ÄúThat I want a woman who knows what she wants‚Äù Helloooooo!!!
Sherma:
	Then your search is still on 
Ish:
	I keep it pretty simple‚Ä¶ you seem to make it more complicated which is fine if your not gonna quit when stakes get too high lol
	You know what you want stop it!!!
	or should I say STOP IT !!!!!!!!! 
	STOP!!!üòÄ
	Is my CAPS writing impressive? Turn my lady on?
Sherma:
	Yup 
Ish:
	I like turning you on
Sherma:
	Shud up
Ish:
	True‚Ä¶.. can I flirt or it‚Äôs too much for my lady?
Sherma:
	3 days, whatever you want 
Ish:
	Except I can‚Äôt see you in person until friday
	You gonna atleast let me do what I want to you Friday?
Sherma:
	Anything you want 
Ish:
	Thanks that‚Äôs hot!!
	Since we have been together ‚Ä¶.. Do you have any do‚Äôs or don‚Äôts ‚Ä¶. Things you like more about wednesday‚Ä¶. Ask and you‚Äôll receive my lady
	I think communication is important in the bedroom, took me by surprise how quiet you were, figured you be barking orders mrs Control freak you are
	Speechless? Thinking?
Sherma:
	I'm a quiet person 
	And I don't think their are any barriers when it comes to sex 
	Hold on 
Ish:
	ok
Sherma:
	Back
Ish:
	k
	Does it bother you to talk about our moment? 
Sherma:
	No it's fine 
Ish:
	How did the twins hold up?
Sherma:
	Is that flirting to you 
Ish:
	what? 
Sherma:
	Earlier you ask if you could flirt 
	And then you ask me that question 
Ish:
	Flirting is instigating sexual relations not talking about past performance
	When I flirt it‚Äôs to get you turned on, this isn‚Äôt what I‚Äôd consider flirting for me‚Ä¶ if it turns you on fine but not what I meant
Sherma:
	My bad 
	Ask another question 
Ish:
	Answer the first ok?
Sherma:
	It's fine 
Ish:
	Twins held up , I know you were worried going in to the event
	They fair game for Friday?
Sherma:
	Guess sob
	Sob =so
Ish:
	Did you like it when I kissed and caressed them ?
Sherma:
	It felt good
	Nice I guess 
Ish:
	They felt fine and looked good to me
	I can kiss them tenderly on friday?
Sherma:
	Yes
Ish:
	That was an example of flirting ok?
Sherma:
	K
Ish:
	We on the same page my lady?
Sherma:
	YeA
Ish:
	No close to tapping or anything? no overheating yet
	no = not
Sherma:
	Not even warm 
	Next 
Ish:
	That was a joke‚Ä¶ just testing my lady checking her faculties
	You said I can be my old self, correct?
	Training wheels off 
Sherma:
	Yup 
Ish:
	Thx‚Ä¶. I‚Äôll start off slow really glad to have you back even if its for a short while
	If we held back on the kissing this time think it might help you from breaking?
	Less heart more mind maybe will keep you out of the clouds
Sherma:
	Is this line of questioning leading somewhere?
Ish:
	Can you get out of your mind and play along ‚Ä¶. This is my lady correct?
	You said ‚Äúanything you want‚Äù‚Ä¶.. You backing off now
	My goal is to keep you around‚Ä¶. if this questions is ‚Äúout of bounds‚Äù just say so‚Ä¶.
	Lets not forget ‚Ä¶. you stated last you week you couldn‚Äôt handle me‚Ä¶. So I‚Äôd like to make sure you can this friday! Thats all‚Ä¶.. This isn‚Äôt about winning anymore for me‚Ä¶. I proved I‚Äôm the better lover ‚Ä¶ now I wanna prove I‚Äôm the better partner as well by lowering my capabilities and intensity so you consider sticking around afterwards this time.   Thats the kind of guy I am‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. one who cares more about my partner (no matter how overmatched) she may be.
	See how nice a guy I am!!!!
	FWIW - That paragraph is a collection of all 3‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Part truth, part flirt, part joke‚Ä¶. Why your crazy about me
	Here‚Äôs where you say Shud up
	Have you forgotten already my lady lol!!!!
	?
	Floor is yours ‚Ä¶..
Sherma:
	I never said that I couldn't handle you and we handled each other well 
Ish:
	Do I have to repost it ‚Ä¶. how quickly we forget
Sherma:
	Don't inflate yourself 
	Repost 
Ish:
	Don‚Äôt need to anymore you did a good enough job already
Sherma:
	Whatever 
Ish:
	I felt myself getting to close and yea probably you could say I couldn't handle you and I decided to walk away
	That‚Äôs your post. your words
	Bring back memories?
Sherma:
	I could see the first and last part. Don't recall saying I couldn't handle you 
Ish:
	Less kissing this time? Think it might be beneficial for you ?
	You said it and your actions backed it up‚Ä¶.. what other girl dumps a guy after having sex with them the 1st time after making em wait a whole month
Sherma:
	Oh my god , that's so fucked, you waited an entire month ?? A whole 30 days .. Wow 
Ish:
	I agree‚Ä¶..
	Less kissing more positions I figure more what your used to you can even call me chris or nurse boy or any other name I don‚Äôt mind won‚Äôt take offense I promise
	Sounds like a plan ( that was all joke that one‚Ä¶. just trying to snap you out of your funk and bring out the lion)
	You back? (more serious question)
Sherma:
	For another 20 mins 
	Wanna take a bubble bath after 
	Bring the questions 
Ish:
	you haven‚Äôt answered one and deny your previous admissions to me
	Will you or won‚Äôt you be able to handle me Friday?
Sherma:
	Handling you is a non issue 
Ish:
	then no tapping the next day correct?
Sherma:
	I tap when I leave you 
Ish:
	You said you couldn‚Äôt last week maybe theres more you didn‚Äôt mean last week 
	What you me ‚Äútap when I leave you‚Äù‚Ä¶.. means your dumping me again after Friday
	me = mean
	Since when has tap become your new favorite word
	It was unheard of before last Wednesday smh
	Is it that you feel the lil bit of control you have over me not that you‚Äôve fallen for me is to threaten to ‚Äútap‚Äù all the time
	not =now
Sherma:
	I got zero control over you cuz you're an independent thinker 
	And no one forces you to do anything 
Ish:
	not true‚Ä¶.. my heart cares and by leaving me you are now in drivers seat again, funny coincidence I guess
	Can we agree to change the subject now that I‚Äôve proven my point?
Sherma:
	Could we not talk about it and 
Ish:
	sure
	You said, the other day‚Ä¶. No thanks to doggie, did you mean it?
Sherma:
	It's on the table 
	What else 
	Keep it coming 
Ish:
	You didn‚Äôt let me go down on you Wednesday how come? Is that on the table Friday
Sherma:
	Table 
Ish:
	Why not on wednesday?
Sherma:
	Not sure, don't recall reasons why 
Ish:
	I do‚Ä¶.. lol..
	We will move on‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
	The bet is off correct? I don‚Äôt feel need to compete anymore ok?
Sherma:
	Bets off 
Ish:
	Thx
	Do you like it better when I‚Äôm on top or when you were on top?
Sherma:
	You 
Ish:
	No more ‚Äúboth‚Äù that must‚Äôve hurt to admit eh?
Sherma:
	A little 
Ish:
	Cmon!!
Sherma:
	Am not bleeding, will live 
Ish:
	So does that mean you on top is off the table?
Sherma:
	I'll be on top also 
Ish:
	You are very fair, thx
	Any questions for me? Any comments or requests?
Sherma:
	Don't fall for me and control your heart 
Ish:
	You fell first plz‚Ä¶
	Thanks for caring, please follow your own advice and try to stick around
	Don‚Äôt be a sore loser and take your ball home 
	Deal?
Sherma:
	Leave your heart at home 
	No room for it 
Ish:
	That‚Äôs why I mentioned less kissing for your benefit
Sherma:
	Plz 
	Kissing does nothing for me 
Ish:
	Don‚Äôt worry about me‚Ä¶. my heart is always in the equation
	You couldn‚Äôt stop kissing me lol!! Who you trying to fool
	You mustve had an out of body experience or something cuz you don‚Äôt remember I guess what took place
Sherma:
	You couldn't get your tongue out of my mouth 
Ish:
	You wouldn‚Äôt let me lol
	Guess the tmj wasn‚Äôt bothering you‚Ä¶. your mouth didn‚Äôt shut for 2 hours
	You even said on the train home you were done talking lol
	Your were 1000% tapped out‚Ä¶. I thought it was a good thing but like usual you found a way to reverse the tables‚Ä¶.Congrats
	My lady never been so satisfied in her life!!!
	Id love to take you back there but not sure its good for you
Sherma:
	I'm good 
Ish:
	So yes I‚Äôll bring my heart but use it a half speed so you don‚Äôt feel overmatched again
Sherma:
	Just worry about you
Ish:
	I‚Äôm bulletproof, your the one who changed not me
	Please just try and stick around‚Ä¶.. You are worth it
	Just tell yourself that you are special and worth it, and worth me.  Don‚Äôt be so insecure and paranoid don‚Äôt leave your confidence at the door this time
	You got this, ok? I believe in you‚Ä¶. try believing in yourself
Sherma:
	Whatever 
Ish:
	Play your cards right and maybe one day you can have friday every nite for the rest of your life‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ That should be your goal‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. Don‚Äôt sell yourself short!
Sherma:
	Let me go, wanna sit in a bubble bath before bed 
Ish:
	One day could I take a bubble bath with you?
Sherma:
	Noooo
Ish:
	Y not?
Sherma:

Ish:

Sherma:
	Choose not to answer 
Ish:
	If I was the best fit would you tell me?
Sherma:
	Stop spinning the question
	You'll get the same result 
Ish:
	You said I fit perfect‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs better then perfect
	Just verifying it a different way thats all
	You said I‚Äôm perfect on train, and now‚Ä¶whats better then perfect my lady
	I‚Äôm the best, it doesn‚Äôt leave this chat‚Ä¶. just tell me truth plz
	If the answer is incomplete you‚Äôll know with more time I‚Äôm fine with that
	But I will pull my penis out of you in middle and make me admit it anyway so Id recommend coming clean tonite
	me =you
Sherma:
	Pull out , not go down , makes no difference .. You're still gonna want me 
	Not worried 
Ish:
	So i‚Äôm not perfect then ok! Appreciate  your honesty
Sherma:
	I didn't say anything 
Ish:
	You said enough, I‚Äôm not stupid
	Im not insecure like you not gonna tap
	All good!
Sherma:

Ish:
	Not to me it isn‚Äôt. lol 
	My feelings for you are the same regardless
Sherma:
	You don't have feeling for me 
	You care , that's it 
Ish:
	I know how to use my apparently ‚Äúimperfect‚Äù member anyway will make up for my flaws
	Please don‚Äôt tell me my feelings‚Ä¶..
	Atleast I talk about mine not hide them like you
	Don‚Äôt internalize em all lil they break me like you
	lil = until
	Besides I have a perfect heart anyway that‚Äôs more important
Sherma:

	Great heart 
Ish:

	It‚Äôs Perfect - you  will be screaming‚Ä¶. mark this post!!!!
Sherma:

Ish:
	You had a test run and broke‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ now the real deal Friday‚Ä¶.. no tapping friday ‚Ä¶ you said it yourself
Sherma:
	Don't define yourself by you penis or performance 
Ish:
	Stick around‚Ä¶.
	Don‚Äôt give me advice unless your willing to stick around otherwise it‚Äôs self serving
Sherma:
	ü§ê
Ish:
	My  penis and performance is what ended this relationship what you talking about
	Hopefully temporarily but lets not confuse things
	Call a spade a spade
Sherma:
	No it wasn't Artie 
Ish:
	Swept away remember?
	Yes it was‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. lol!
Sherma:
	I put everything in it when k say it had nothing to do with having sex 
	Don't tell me what I know 
Ish:
	Likewise
	You said you let me go cuz you got to close‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Sex changed you swept you away and you got vulnerable
Sherma:
	You make assumptions, I'm telling you the truth 
Ish:
	What is the truth? tell me again why you tapped or do I need to repost what you said
	I don‚Äôt want you to tap ‚Ä¶.. I‚Äôll change my approach and change the way I make love to you if you‚Äôd like‚Ä¶.
	Anything to make you happy but not too happy
	you say your incapable but your not. You did good with me‚Ä¶
	You bring up old relationships and stuff that really have no bearing on us‚Ä¶. humans evolve
	I bring it back up to prove to you that‚Äôs all that its nonsense
	You say past can‚Äôt be revisited but your actions suggest otherwise
	You are a walking paradox‚Ä¶ when it comes to me‚Ä¶. reason I know your falling for me.
	I also have a cool interpretation of your new tattoo ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll tell you what I think it should mean on Friday‚Ä¶.. Like I said you ain‚Äôt see nothing yet my lady
	Anything to say my lady?

Ish:
	YW hopefully my concerns will be rewarded Friday
Sherma:

Ish:
	Of course! I'm many track minded unlike you
	I like to keep things even keeled so I am able to stick around you should try it my lady
Sherma:
	I kneel to no man, my lord 
Ish:
	Never mentioned anything about kneeling plz get your mind out of the gutter plz
	Even keeled means calm
	I know In the past I got you over excited plz try and keep it together you got this!! Your not as overmatched as you think
Sherma:
	Gotcha 
Ish:
	It's a marathon not a sprint ok?
Sherma:
	Heard it a few times 
Ish:
	Is a few times too much for you ?
Sherma:
	Depends
Ish:
	I know Only if I'm on top , correct?
Sherma:
	Wasn't thinking in that line but if you say so 
Ish:
	Really I thought you had it all figured out my lady 
	Did you have a chance to read my final comments last nite ?
Sherma:
	About me falling for you ?
Ish:
	Any response?
	File Transfer: IMG_5698.jpeg
	It'll be our secret
Sherma:
	Hmmm, I was feeling ur 
Ish:
	Is that a good thing or bad thing?
Sherma:
	It became a chain reaction 
	I tapped 
Ish:
	We all make emotional decisions it's ok ! It's been a while for you 
Sherma:
	Been a while regarding what exactly ?
Ish:
	The whole chain of events
	Strong feelings .... Being dominated by a man.... Perfect equipment .... Countless O's.... Falling hard.... Lack of sleep 
	Past relationships not going your way .... Need I say more?
	You there? Benadryl kick back in?
Sherma:
	Here 
Ish:
	U gonna comment? Any rebuttal
Sherma:
	Not strong feeling but feelings non the less. I like the fact that I  could control my situation. I got no problems with past relations, it's already pass 
	But I do have insomnia 
	Not from anything in particular 
Ish:
	Not buying this cmon!
	This is uncharted waters for my lady
	Not strong feelings lol!!
	You are hilarious ! 
	It's ok don't worry I'm a rock ! Not tap in me
	Not = no
	You claimed last week I knocked 30 years off ur life 
	If that's not strong feelings I don't know what is
	Cmon just admit it's a good thing! 
	Embrace it don't run my lady 
	It's a once in a lifetime event and you have a front row seat ..... Walking paradox I said remember -- example - you claim to have insomnia - how come last week you fell asleep and snoozed and losed? 
	Thanks for giving us a 2nd chance I'll be forever grateful even if it doesn't work out .... You are special! My lady is a fighter
	Just focus your fighting on staying not attacking me anymore plz 
Sherma:
	Hold up, never claimed that you knocked years off my life 
Ish:
	Yes you did you claimed to be feeling like a teenager again
	Should I repost it? How quickly we forge lol
	Forget
	Remember now ?
Sherma:
	Stop re-reading the post, damn
Ish:
	Then remember plz
	You always questioning me ? After all this why?
	Believe!!! Lol
	Sorry to break the bad news my lady but you were a teenager 30 years ago :(
	And you wanna knock my penis smfh 
	Floors yours my lady... I recommend to start with an apology just saying üòò
Sherma:
	Apology Psssh ??? The only thing fun about being a teenager is that you think the world revolves around you. 
Ish:
	Always down playing me 
Sherma:
	The feeling of a woman vs a girl. The woman def gets off, knowing her body and enjoying more sensual pleasure 
Ish:
	Did you get off last Wednesday ?
Sherma:
	I did 
Ish:
	How many times?
Sherma:
	Couple 
Ish:
	Cmon !!!! 
	A couple = 2 ! Atleast a few admit it
	Always downplaying me my lady Why?
Sherma:
	Couple meaning a few 
Ish:
	Mrs "I want the truth" never seems to reciprocate 
	You don't know the exact number? 
Sherma:
	Didn't realize you needed a specific number 
	I wasn't counting 
Ish:
	Lost count?
Sherma:
	Didn't think it was important 
Ish:
	Sooo an orgasm isn't important to you?
	Cmon!!!
Sherma:
	Of course it is 
Ish:
	We're the amount of orgasms you experienced with me more or less then your used to?
Sherma:
	You were right up there w the others 
Ish:
	Your killing me
	My lady is cruel 
	Love ripping my heart out and stomping it 
Sherma:
	I'm not crude 
	Cruel
Ish:
	You broke up with me after our first time doesn't get crueler then that
	And comparing me to your others is a total kick in my groin ... Obviously an intended low blow by my lady
	You really love to tear me down smh
	Not tapping tho ! 
Sherma:
	Would try and not hurt you or mislead you, okay
	If I keep it real with you, my only expectation if for you to be accepting 
	Deal ??
Ish:
	Whatever you say my lady 
	You know what you did 
	It was a low blow and you enjoyed it and worded the answer to land directly on my testicles 
Sherma:
	Lol

Ish:
	100% .... You built me up enough so you could break me down hardest .... Totally set me up
Sherma:

Ish:
	Do I back it up?
Sherma:

Ish:
	Not me all you!!!
	Your the admitted selfish one not me.... Wouldn't surprise me one bit that every time you orgasm you say ohhh Sherma 
	That's why U so quiet in bed
Sherma:
	Won't you like to know !!
Ish:
	Even your own orgasms u take credit for
Sherma:
	I'm gonna keep it above the belt 
	No low punches 
Ish:
	That would be the first please
	You live below my belt! 
Sherma:
	Am afraid of hurting your ego and you won't be able to rebound 
Ish:
	Never stopped you before go ahead I give you permission like you need it anyway

	Might move to Canada or England. Trinidad is also an option 
Ish:

	That's fine I understand np
	No reason to worry about something that's isn't official anyway
Sherma:

Sherma:
	I don't want them to leave 
	All the time 
Ish:
	Sounds like you need them more then they need you 
Sherma:
	It is true 
Ish:
	Not good
	I don't believe that's the case but it's cute 
	But all too familiar with over protective parents so I'm probably not the most objective person 
	It's not my place really and I have faith in you anyway 
	If I didn't I probably wouldn't give you a second night (chance) so please consider yourself very lucky 
	üòá
Sherma:
	I thank you for you kind words sir 
Ish:
	You welcome you earned a mulligan 
	You know I'm a giving guy

Sherma:
	He said I'm exotic beauty and I won't  have to sleep with him. 
	Just be there so he coul see me every day till the end 
Ish:
	Must be tough feel for you being with people near the end would break my heart couldn't do it
Sherma:
	That was like the sweetest thing ever 
Ish:
	I respect that qualtiy about you
	Dr.s make all the money and nurses do all the dirty work smh
Sherma:
	It's hard when you click w a patient 
	And they don't have long to live 
Ish:
	I can imagine 
	Very tough and what's worse IMO is getting used to it
	But the human body adapts 
	I never thought I would last in jail but believe it or not I did somehow
	Tragedy of life is not death but what dies inside while you live !
Sherma:
	I had this one pt, an old woman and when I walked in she was like, did God sent you, you are an angel. She kissed my hands all day and cried when I left 
	I promise her I would be back to see her the next day and I was too tired and didn't make it .. She died a few days later and I didn't get to see her 
Ish:
	Sad! Atleast u gave her hope 
Sherma:
	So yea, I love my job and my patients 
	The best part is making a difference 
	You may not think much of me but when I walk into their room and they light up, it's the greatest feeling one could experience 
Ish:
	Very sweet and stop with the negativity "may not think much of me" 
	STOP IT
Sherma:
	You think I'm an ego maniac but that's furthest from the truth 
Ish:
	Stop it ! Never said that your words 
	Besides how you interact with me doesn't define you as a person or how u are at your job cmon !!
Sherma:
	Just want to tell you about my patients 
Ish:
	Please do so with out taking the liberty to throw digs at me is all I'm saying 
	I'm trying to compliment you and you still wanna cut me up smh
Sherma:
	You read it wrong 
	It wasn't that serious 
Ish:
	Likewise
	File Transfer: IMG_2088.jpeg

	Admit it!!
Sherma:
	I won't, even tho I may think it 
	Won't say it 
Ish:
	Why not ?
Sherma:
	Words once it's out it can't go back in .. So I make a conscious decision to watch what o say 
Ish:
	Can I ask you a question and promise to answer honestly?
Sherma:
	If I can 
Ish:
	Are you seeing me tommorrow cuz you want to or you feel obligated ?
Sherma:
	One and only question or is their a follow up ?
Ish:
	Idk I'll use your favorite word "depends "
Sherma:
	Not obligated but I did give you my word. I also wanted to be with you 
	And see you 
Ish:
	All of the above just say 
	Say a lot but don't tell anything damn ur good
	What are you looking forward to most for tommorrow?
Sherma:
	Getting in bed with you

Ish:

Sherma:

	That's my main reason for going 
Ish:

Sherma:

Sherma:
	I don't want you staring at my body 
Ish:
	We talked bout this I don't stare
	What kinda surprise u have in mind?
Sherma:
	I said I like true religion 
	U delivered 
	Like Nike 
	Delivered 
	Fcuk 
	Don't know 
Ish:
	I'm not gay sorry
	You upset?
	I wore a hat -- you recommended one I delivered 
	I wore sneakers - you recommend one I delivered 
Sherma:
	Forget it 
Ish:
	Do I wear cologne?
Sherma:
	Yes 
	I like cologne 
Ish:
	I don't wear cologne that's my own manly fermones that turned you on
	I have a saying and it's actually my own 
	It goes like this !! Since 1992 I first said it to my first love 
	I'll will cut my finger off for you but won't cut my hair!
	You understand my proverb?
Sherma:
	Is your hair suppose to represent something ?
	Don't get it 
Ish:
	It means I'll give you anything of myself but won't change myself ..... Take me as is!!
	Understand better?
Sherma:
	Don't get it 
	Seems like a trivial thing to do 
Ish:
	Trivial then why you asking?
Sherma:
	For you 
	Why can't you do something for me 
Ish:
	For me ? Lol cologne always represent a kind of desperation to me
Sherma:
	You could be telling another female 10 years from now that this brown chick pressured you into wearing cologne 
	And I'm so glad she did 
Ish:
	I've done things for you already lol
	If I need cologne to get chicks to like me not my kinda girl most likely 
Sherma:
	But I like it 
Ish:
	If she's telling her friends or worse my friends reason she like me was cuz of my cologne I'd probably cry lol
	Have any of your other men wore the fcuk stuff?
Sherma:
	He wore Versace 
Ish:
	Who did ?
Sherma:
	Chris 
Ish:
	Did your other men wear any cologne?
Sherma:
	Yes 
Ish:
	Cool! Good for them 
	If you stick around I'll consider it best I'll commit to
Sherma:
	It means I'll give you anything of myself but won't change myself ..... Take me as is!!
	Don't change who you are for me 
Ish:
	I'm not saying I'll do it just not ruling it out 
	I'm not stupid I'm very close to spending a sultry night with you .... I'm not gonna argue strongly about anything with you lol
	Whatever u say my lady I'll consider don't worry ü§ò
	I'll explain the take me as is proverb later in person I promise you'll understand the true genius behind it
Sherma:
	Shish .. Let me tap, kids getting heavy 
Ish:
	Then you'll be happy to rescind the cologne request IMHO 
Sherma:
	Kids -Lids 
Ish:
	GN didn't know you were home .... I'll do my best to keep up with Chris & co. ...Thx for heads up

	Am not on your head 
Ish:
	Nope about you being over yours 
	Stop flipping this around my lady
Sherma:
	Do you know how many times I've heard you say, I could tell you so many stories about Ish and I 
	It I could tell you the things fih and I use to
	So you recall me saying to you that your not over you ex ?? You talk about her all the time 
	That's okay, means you still have a good connection with her 
Ish:
	I have a child with her hellooooo! I try and be civil unlike you with your ex... Sorry I don't have a million and one ex's like u
Sherma:
	Truly I'm all for it, will actually support your decision 
Ish:
	I'm a nice guy not my fault you get jealous it's not my intention ! I'm only interested in you! Your the one who keeps mentioning ending this relationship 
	So it's not fair to compare my ex wife with your ex boyfriend 
	Your obviously not over him and the reason you keep pushing me away
	You can be honest with me I'm not gonna break or anything 
Sherma:
	I swear I'm not jealous, it's that when you talk about her, I rooting for you. I'm not against you 
Ish:
	Enough Stop it!!! Please answer my question thx
	Are you over Chris?
Sherma:
	I don't know, there was never any closure 
Ish:
	Is that the reason your so incapable with me?
Sherma:
	Seem like the obvious reason 
Ish:
	So all that stuff about going thru a divorce and stuff wasn't the case 
Sherma:
	In combination too 
Ish:
	I understand 
	Thx for letting me know 
	How often do you talk with him?
Sherma:
	Depends 
	It's not an everyday thing 
Ish:
	Do you tell him you love him?
Sherma:
	No
Ish:
	Never have?
Sherma:
	No 
Ish:
	Don't understand 
Sherma:
	Neither one of them 
Ish:
	Ok 
	So you won't take me seriously until you have closure with him?
Sherma:
	I slept with you 2x it does mean something to me 
Ish:
	I know it gets me only a month 
	Whoopee!!
Sherma:
	Don't be mean 
Ish:
	Your words not mine just keeping it real 
	I like these heart to hearts 
Sherma:
	You don't take it well tho 
Ish:
	And let's not forget I had to beg and plead to get the 2nd night and you still almost blew me off
	And you have cold feet to see me again 
	I take it fine..... I'm a realist ! It is what it is
	I enjoy the moments and let the other stuff take care of itself 
	Your the one looking for the exit not me! I'll live with it .... You have free will! 
	Your still hung up on someone else I'm not gonna tell you make a choice or anything it's your body and feelings you do what's best for you! I'm not gonna worry about things I can't control
	Personally I think your in denial but what do I know
Sherma:

Ish:

Sherma:
	Didn't you had enough of me last week 
	?
	Whee did you go ?
Ish:
	Making a sandwich sorry 
	Never enough just getting started wanna get my months worth that's all
Sherma:
	Completely understandable 
Ish:
	You had enough of me? 
Sherma:
	Nope 
Ish:
	My appetite too big for you?
Sherma:
	Nope but your ego is 
Ish:
	What ego? The one you keep  imagining I have 
Sherma:
	The one I sat on :)
Ish:
	stop beating me up plz it's overkill
	Why you always picking on me?
Sherma:
	I'm like the most gentle person you would ever have the pleasure of knowing 
Ish:
	Not too me
	Seems like your always trying to pick and push my buttons
Sherma:
	It gets me wet 
Ish:
	Then keep doing it np
Sherma:
	Foreplay 
Ish:
	Pick and push away my lady no complaints
Sherma:
	I like how you do that switch 
	From stop fucking w me to fuck me :)
Ish:
	I'm all for foreplay 
Sherma:
	Did you miss me ?
Ish:
	Yup
	I enjoy your company 
Sherma:
	In bed or outta ??
Ish:
	both
Sherma:
	Pick one ?
Ish:
	Remember most of time we spend together has been outta
	If I had to pick‚Ä¶.. I guess I‚Äôd say in bed since its newer
	Variety is always good keeps things fresh and exciting
	Which do you prefer?
Sherma:
	Anything that distracts you from talking 
	Prefer you kidding me more 
	So I would have to say in bed 
Ish:
	So is it a good possibility that on Saturday we might spend some time in the sack together?
Sherma:
	Good possibility 
Ish:
	In bed do you prefer me kissing you or fucking you more?
Sherma:
	Both 
Ish:
	If you had to pick one
Sherma:
	That's hard 
	Fucking 
Ish:
	I like doing both‚Ä¶.. so I‚Äôm not gonna deprive you of either
	Is there a favorite position you prefer when we fuck?
Sherma:
	It was all good 
	You were really good 
Ish:
	The best?
Sherma:
	Soooo
	About sat 
Ish:
	What about Sat?
Sherma:
	I'm just gonna say this 
	If sex was terrible I won't be with you 
Ish:
	So if I did have ED‚Ä¶ you‚Äôd bounce?
Sherma:
	If you got it after we fucked , no!!
	I would stay 
Ish:
	Thanks for avoiding my best question‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. But you did try and dump me after our first sexual encounter so I don‚Äôt know what to think
	But I‚Äôm not gonna dwell on it‚Ä¶..
	Obviously you don‚Äôt want me to think I‚Äôm the best‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ you apparently don‚Äôt wanna feed my ego.  But I know the truth and this saturday I will be even better
Sherma:
	I don't want you to have to tell your next conquest the last person you had couldn't get enough of you. She kept saying baby ur the best I've ever had 
Ish:
	Why you always do that? smh ‚Ä¶.. reminding me of the apocalypse
	You always act like we have no future‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ You have  no crystal ball my lady always remember that
	Is negativity such a large part of you DNA?
Sherma:
	Nope reality is 
Ish:
	What reality is that Madame Sherma?
	
	
Sherma:
	Don't see shit
Ish:
	Then try and stop talking shit about us please
	We good for each other stop questioning it and let it run its course please
	Enjoy it while it lasts ok?
Sherma:
	U putting down your foot with me .. Lol 
Ish:
	What you trying to say?
Sherma:
	Sounds like ur telling me to shut up 
	And stop trying to predict the future 
Ish:
	Will you follow my advice?
Sherma:
	Hell no 
	But I will take it to advisement 
Ish:
	whatever your sooo thick
	Have you come up with a game plan for saturday?
Sherma:
	Anything goes 
	Plans out the window 
Ish:
	Anything goes = all niter?
Sherma:
	Free range 
Ish:
	You wanna spend another nite with me?
Sherma:
	If you behave well , maybe 
	All niter 
	You've matured within the last 48 hrs 
Ish:
	I have very much so
	Are you gonna cap the amount of time we do it?
Sherma:
	No capping or tapping for the next month 
Ish:
	Am I allowed to wake you up while your sleeping to do it?
Sherma:
	I would be disappointed if you didn't 
Ish:
	Can I just plunge in or would you rather me lick  you before
Sherma:
	Make sure I'm wet before you plunge 
	Or else ur just gonna hurt me 
Ish:
	I thought your always wet
Sherma:
	Just saying . Damn 
Ish:
	Ok i‚Äôll respect your wishes my lady
	No chance of me seeing you before saturday correct?
Sherma:
	Not likely :(
Ish:
	ok figured I‚Äôd ask‚Ä¶. you seem anxious just checking thats all
	We will just have to make up for it on Saturday‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.
Sherma:
	For this week 
	Me anxious ?? 
	Seems you can't wait 
Ish:
	Sure‚Ä¶ probably be best to add another week to our month relationship to compensate for the inactivity‚Ä¶..
	I‚Äôm always ready to go‚Ä¶.. I‚Äôm the one with the bigger appetite no question about that
	Your the overmatched one not me
Sherma:
	Haha 
Ish:
	I can‚Äôt wait cuz my appetite wasn‚Äôt filled‚Ä¶‚Ä¶I‚Äôm still hungry you apparently was completely satisfied and a bit overwhelmed to be honest
Sherma:
	You get 4 meals for that month 
Ish:
	My appetite is obviously much bigger then yours‚Ä¶ np my lady.. since we fucked already I won‚Äôt leave you ‚Ä¶.. ed or not‚Ä¶ i‚Äôll stick by you
	Im just happy I was able to fill you up and completely satisfy your hunger
	I‚Äôm good like that!!
Sherma:
	Lol .. Funny 
Ish:
	Proof is in pudding‚Ä¶. you need a week to recuperate‚Ä¶ not me

Sherma:
	Reverse psychology 
	Plz
Ish:
	It‚Äôs ok‚Ä¶.. I‚Äôll wait for you‚Ä¶. your my lady
	Take all the time you need
Sherma:
	Don't say that, you're gonna wanna eat those words 
	I could say we'll hook up in 2 weeks 
	And they you would really be deprived 
	Good thing you didn't come in today , it's messy outside 
Ish:
	Cmon‚Ä¶. a lil rain don‚Äôt deter me
	You‚Äôve already had me wait 2 weeks nothing new with me
	Wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if you needed another 2 weeks
Sherma:

	U waited 10 days 
Ish:
	Damn you counted the days‚Ä¶ lol
	Admit you really like me‚Ä¶ C‚Äômon!!!
Sherma:

	I kindda like you 
Ish:
	Keep pushing‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ you reap what you sow
	Can‚Äôt wait to tell my next conquest my last girl needed weeks to recover from me
Sherma:
	She would love that .. I'll talk to the pundit, let me see if he thinks ur good for me or not 
Ish:
	If the pandit likes me would you stay longer then a month?
Sherma:
	5 weeks ?
	You would get one more in 
Ish:
	Whatever you can handle‚Ä¶ its quite obvious you can‚Äôt fuck regularly‚Ä¶. Your tight lil pussy can‚Äôt handle my big dick
Sherma:
	I promise to not hurt you as much 
	I handled your dick very well 
Ish:
	Hurt me by running and tapping? Your not capable of hurting me in the sack never happen

Sherma:
	I made you cum by getting on top, didn't I ??
	That's all am gonna say 
Ish:
	If sex was terrible I won't be with you

Sherma:

	You told me that .. Lol 
Ish:
	Unlike you i give credit where credit is due‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôm honest to you about my true feelings
	Your the one always hitting the brakes not me

Ish:
	Thx!
	Any chance this saturday could be better then last week?
Sherma:
	I don't put to much thought into fucking 
Ish:
	Liar!!
	You are all thought!!
Sherma:
	Whoa ? 
	Where did that come from ?
Ish:
	It wasn‚Äôt meant to be mean
Sherma:
	I enjoy being with you 
Ish:
	You saying you don‚Äôt think is a total fabrication
Sherma:
	What is ?
	Me thinking too much ?
Ish:
	Correct
	Not thinking at all is the fabrication
	You DO think a lot‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ you‚Äôve admitted it
	Saying you don‚Äôt think about fucking me is also a big fabrication‚Ä¶. cmon!!!
	Just so we on same page‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.Your statement 'I don't put to much thought into fucking‚Äô ‚Ä¶.. I feel was a bit inaccurate (liar might‚Äôve been a bit strong but you‚Äôve used the word describing me a few times)
	Especially considering a lot of our conversation today was about fucking‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ smh
Sherma:
	Wat would you like the walk about, the weather ?
	It's fucking pouring out 
Ish:
	Does it matter for you  since it‚Äôs pouring outside and your pouring inside
	I enjoy our conversations
Sherma:
	
This type of weather makes me want some 
Ish:
	Lets do it!!
Sherma:
	Cuddling and staying in bed
Ish:
	Is that an invitation?
Sherma:
	I'm telling you what I like 
Ish:
	I‚Äôm listening‚Ä¶.. I‚Äôm the same way
	Thunderstorms are even more erotic IMHO
Sherma:
	No way , that's the best time 
Ish:
	Yup
	I actually enjoy walks in the rain too
Sherma:
	Nah, I'm brown 
Ish:
	as long as rain isn‚Äôt really down pouring
Sherma:
	I get sick really quickly 
Ish:
	Weak genes‚Ä¶ sorry
	My genes are almost indestructible except the other week
	Probably should keep my mouth shut don‚Äôt wanna jinx myself 
Sherma:
	Lol
	We were never allowed to play in the rain growing up 
	And now I can't 
	Even its 100 degrees and rains, still can't get wet 
Ish:
	Im sure if I inject you with some of my DNA you‚Äôll be fine
Sherma:
	Fortunately last week I got wet but didn't get sick 
Ish:
	2 or 3 injections of my seamen and you‚Äôll be fine
Sherma:
	Maybe I got some of your genes 
Ish:
	Proved my point about my injections
	Have you considered taking off the ring and letting me put a bun in there?
Sherma:
	Nope, I'm good 
Ish:
	Don‚Äôt wanna boy?
Sherma:
	Nope 
Ish:
	Don‚Äôt know what your missing OMG
	Np‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm fine with what I have
Sherma:
	I think I only need sex for now 
	Nothing more 
Ish:
	Once every week or two, I get it
	At this sex rate, can I petition you for 2 months instead of 1
Sherma:
	Shud up 
	You live to far and maybe if you had a 1 bdrm apt I would be over 3 -4 times a week fucking you
Ish:
	Now its my fault, lol
	Your schedule is too busy I thought
Sherma:
	This week it is 
Ish:
	I understand‚Ä¶. maybe one day that could be the case‚Ä¶. thanks for the inspiration
Sherma:
	Don't you want me to show up with just my jacket on 
	No panties and heels only 
	Can't say no to that 
Ish:
	Correct. Its sounds very nice and sexy
	Unfortunately only things pops in my head is you‚Äôve probably done all that stuff with your other ex‚Äôs
	Rather make new memories
Sherma:
	Wet blanket
Ish:
	Don‚Äôt understand?
	What you trying to say?
Sherma:
	I was hot and you threw a wet blanket on me 
	Kill the mood 
Ish:
	We have time‚Ä¶. 5 days to water the plants
	I don‚Äôt have a place yet anyway‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.Ain‚Äôt gonna get one in a month either , you‚Äôl be long gone by then
Sherma:

Ish:

Sherma:
	Nope 
Ish:
	You said you like kissing me as much as fucking me
	Was that a lie?
Sherma:
	No
Ish:
	Thank YOU! I rest my case
Sherma:
	What case is that ?
Ish:
	Kissing = loving
	And last weekend I pushed your loving past its limits
Sherma:
	Kissing = lust

Ish:
	So you lusted for me since our 2nd date?
Sherma:
	I'm just digging myself into a fucking deeper hole 
	Gonna shut up now 
Ish:
	Yup! Its apparently what you do best with me
	Thank God I have very long arms to pull you out
Sherma:
	Aaawh my life saver 
Ish:
	So you agree I have long arms?
Sherma:
	No you don't 
Ish:
	Cmon! admit it
Sherma:

Ish:

Sherma:

Sherma:

Ish:
	Thank you‚Ä¶. So the 1 month decree has been abolished?
Sherma:
	No 
Ish:

	You said you don‚Äôt have a crystal ball
	Is is impossible for my lady to be fair? wtf
Sherma:
	That's bcuz I'm brown .. 
Ish:
	Wtf does color have anything to do
Sherma:
	Can't be fair if I'm brown 
Ish:
	üñï
Sherma:
	It's a joke .. Haha
Ish:
	Ok, thanks
	So the 1 month decree is a distant memory
Sherma:
	Shush ..I wanna tell you something 
	If I close my eyes I could feel you inside of me 
	I was having sex with you in my dream last nite 
	Don't let it get to your head 
Ish:
	I thought you don't remember dreams
Sherma:
	Didn't want you to get too excited 
Ish:
	Seems you never want to get me excited .... Is it cuz you know you can't tame the beast in me and that scares u
Sherma:
	It's not the beast I'm worried about 
Ish:
	What worries u
Sherma:
	Not having a full proof plan in my life 
	Did I mention to you yesterday that one if my patients groped me 
Ish:
	no u didn‚Äôt
	same guy who proposed to you?
Sherma:
	Nope 
	20 something year old 
Ish:
	did u file a complaint
Sherma:
	Yea
Ish:
	Good for you , you don‚Äôt need that shit
Sherma:
	Both places 
	My ass and vag
Ish:
	Thats terrible‚Ä¶. sorry to hear that
Sherma:
	Felt violated 
Ish:
	Sorry mustve reminded you of me and my previous violations
	Now I know why you cancelled today‚Ä¶. I completely understand
	I forgive you‚Ä¶ 
	Take all time you need‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Want me to come by hospital and kick this guys ass
Sherma:
	No .. You did nothing wrong with me 
	Been thru some shit in my life , just bad memories 
	That's all 
Ish:
	I can imagine‚Ä¶. sorry it happened.  We didn‚Äôt talk yesterday while you were working and you said work was good.  I guess that might‚Äôve been the reason you had cold feet yesterday
Sherma:
	Usually how it works for me is that my body shuts down and my thoughts take me to a safe place 
Ish:
	What works are you describing?
Sherma:
	Me coping with shit
Ish:
	Shit like me?
Sherma:
	NO 
Ish:
	Shit like groping and sex harassment and stuff
Sherma:
	I don't want your sympathy or you saying I'm sorry 
	Listen without interrupting 
	Ok
Ish:
	üëç
Sherma:
	Shish 
	I was raped as a little girl and whenever I feel closed in or touched the wrong way without consent. My body shuts down 
	Yesterday was not good for me
	Everything flood right back in 
	And I'm that little girl again 
	So basically that's where my head have been 
Ish:
	Your a strong woman‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ I can imagine thx for telling me
Sherma:
	I am most of the times 
	That's the reason I've never had sexy with my first love even though we dated for 3 plus years 
	Sexy=sex
Ish:
	I understand (I‚Äôm happy you didn‚Äôt make me wait 3 years).. but it helps me understand you better.  Can I ask you a question about this?
Sherma:
	Sure 
Ish:
	Did the person get away with it(incident when you were younger)?
Sherma:
	Yea, he was my next door neighbor and I was 6 yrs old 
	And 25 lbs 
Ish:
	How old was the neighbor?
Sherma:
	13 and about 150 lbs 
Ish:
	Thanks‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ very sorry for the pain you went thru both during and after. I don‚Äôt have any other questions.
Sherma:
	What worse was sitting across him at my dad funeral. My legs were shaking 
	And I could feel my insides trembling 
Ish:
	He never got in trouble? Did you ever tell anyone?
Sherma:
	No, I would have looked upon or shun I think if other people knew 
	One of the neighbors found me past out and she took me home 
	My mom knew and I was hospitalized for 2 weeks 
Ish:
	How many other people have you told about this?
Sherma:
	Few family members know and my ex that lives in Brooklyn, I never told Chris 
	Or my children 
Ish:
	Ever told your husband?
Sherma:
	Yup , it book me a long time to be comfortable with him 
	Sometimes a certain breath in my body will remind me of the incident 
Ish:
	Was their alcohol involved?
Sherma:
	In= on 
	No
Ish:
	Thats a lot to digest‚Ä¶.. Didn‚Äôt initially realize when you answer yea‚Ä¶ that is meant the rapist got away with it
	Why was this guy allowed to be at the funeral‚Ä¶. Your mom is still alive
	Is he mentally handicapped or something
Sherma:
	No.. He knew the family and came to the funeral 
	Mom wasn't in any state nor do I think she saw him 
Ish:
	Its sad‚Ä¶. I kinda/almost had an incident like that with my son‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. Thank God it didn‚Äôt get to the level it did with you‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs a lot to wrap your mind around‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
Sherma:
	It is quite a bit to ingest 
Ish:
	Hearing it‚Ä¶. makes me kinda angry and shit‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ feel like getting revenge and shit‚Ä¶ not a good place‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. 
	Feel for you‚Ä¶.. if you wanna wait till the 10th date I‚Äôll be ok with it 
	You still there? ok?
Sherma:
	Had to step away 
	That's something that I thought I would have to live with for the rest of my life 
	But I refuse to be defined by rape and molestation 
	So it made me stronger and wasn't necessary for me to have a man in my life 
	I felt violated by my husband and somehow felt worse than the rape
	Hold on 
Ish:
	k
Sherma:
	Hope that explains how I became who I am 
	I know it's a lot, so don't need you to feel sorry for me but to better understand me 
Ish:
	Thanks‚Ä¶ it was helpful‚Ä¶. I won‚Äôt take it easy on you and still expect you to put out this weekend, ok?
	I think theres more under you hood then just what you‚Äôve explained but it nice to garner some of your trust to share with me‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm sure theres other stuff but not on this scale I‚Äôm sure‚Ä¶ Atleast I hope so for your sake
Sherma:
	To sum it up I'm emotionally scarred and don't wanna go thru another round w anyone else. I've had my fill 
	That's the honest truth 
Ish:
	aren‚Äôt we all some more then others 
	I totally understand your perspective with me‚Ä¶.
	If i could just close my eyes and get laid and even get laid in my sleep without being close to the person‚Ä¶.wft‚Ä¶ You got it real good.  Damn girl
	I‚Äôm surprised were even still talking‚Ä¶.. must be nice for you‚Ä¶Now i understand better why women get rid of me so quickly
	One perpetual orgasm is my effect on you‚Ä¶ Damn if I could just bottle it up I‚Äôd be rich!!!
	Maybe I should sell my own cologne‚Ä¶ screw this fcuk bullshit
Sherma:
	Plz don't flatter yourself 
Ish:
	cmon trying to cheer you up and get you back to your old stubborn no credit giving self‚Ä¶. I see its working already smh
Sherma:
	That song with drake and Kanye, bless 
	Do you know it 
Ish:
	not on top of my head
Sherma:
	Ooh 
Ish:
	What about it
	Big Sean?
Sherma:
	Lyrics : I'm here for a good time, not a long time 
Ish:
	So that's how you justify getting rid of me after a month
Sherma:
	I haven't had a good time in a long time
Ish:
	Listening to it now .... Never heard this song before
Sherma:
	It's a good song 
Ish:
	Not my kinda of song tbh
	Especially if it inspires you to dump me
Sherma:
	Lol
	That was my jam not so long ago 
	And now it's edm
	Anything to drown out outside interference 
Ish:
	Edm?
Sherma:
	Yup
	Calvin Harris 
Ish:
	I'm not much of a fan of Kanye west

Ish:
	Please start drinking water then otherwise you gonna end up in hospital and will not be getting paid either to stay
Sherma:
	thinking in terms of dehydration or my health ?
Ish:
	I do care, taking an interest in your medical status 
	If you were to be in any discomfort or pain, it should only come from me 
Sherma:
	Verbatim 
Ish:
	Just drink water plz don't wanna dial 911 when you realize your overmatched
Sherma:
	This is about Sat night ? No worries 
Ish:

	I care about u
Sherma:
	Yea yea 
Ish:

Ish:
	My favorite UFC fighter is fighting on PPV, figure we can go out and I‚Äôll show you what real fighting is about
	He fights March 5‚Ä¶. Figure we can go somewhere, anywhere to watch the event
	Besides that the destination will be the obvious
Sherma:
	My lord is becoming predictable 
	You looking to bed me at every turn 
Ish:
	If it ain't broken why fix it
	You need the practice and in willing to teach 
	in = I'm 
Sherma:
	I do ?
Ish:
	Yup
	You obviously haven't been with anyone my caliber 
	If you can finish me again from the top then you'll have my attention otherwise it was just beginners luck 
Sherma:
	As long as I get you to cum I'm already at the top 
	Been there since the 3rd date 
Ish:
	Don't understand what your saying 
	We didn't have sex on our 3rd date , the only one who came was you on the steps 
Sherma:
	I know, I'm sure you went home and jerk off 
	So it does count 
Ish:
	Only in your dreams 
Sherma:
	Hold up 
Ish:
	Physical contact is all that counts IMO
Sherma:
	Are you telling me you didn't ??
Ish:
	Didn't what ?
Sherma:
	Jerk off after the 3rd date and all that heavy kissing you were laying on me 
Ish:
	That's none of your business you have some nerve accusing me of such behaviour 
Sherma:
	I'm confirming my lord 
	Not accusing 
Ish:
	This is the really real world ! You only get credit for what you do in person
	Otherwise I'd take credit for all the dreams you have but I'm not
Sherma:
	One dream and you can !!
Ish:
	I'm sure you've masturbated about me more then I do about you fwiw
	I don't kiss and tell! We will see this Saturday if your performance was luck or skill from on top 
	Nervous? 
Sherma:
	It's a long way away 
Ish:
	Will you be nervous on Friday?
	Think your performance was lucky last time?
Sherma:
	Plz gimme some credit 
Ish:
	Once a week!!! Cmon! You lost all your credit
Sherma:
	I'm like a rich dessert, can't have it everyday 
Ish:
	Correct cuz it‚Äôs unhealthy and will kill you and make you fat
Sherma:
	That's why you get it once per week 
Ish:
	Bullshit!!
Sherma:
	Only looking after your health status 
Ish:
	I‚Äôm very healthy I‚Äôm not brown
Sherma:
	Are you saying I'm unhealthy ?
Ish:
	Cmon!!
	You said everytime you get wet you get sick
	Everytime we get together you run like a river. cmon!!
	You and water is a recipe for disaster apparently
	Plus you claim you don‚Äôt like meat‚Ä¶. How in the hell you gonna handle my meat more then once a week‚Ä¶. SMH!!
	No water, no meat‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. Admit your overmatched!!!!
	Or atleast way out of practice and your comfort zone
Sherma:
	Whatever makes you feel like the "man"
Ish:
	You made me feel like a man last weekend thx
	Think you‚Äôll be able to repeat that performance Saturday?
Sherma:
	Untapped skills 
Ish:
	Don‚Äôt understand
Sherma:
	Means u ent seen notten yet 
Ish:
	Puhlease!!! Your funny
	I surely hope so‚Ä¶. You had over a weeks rest
Sherma:
	Rest ??
	Not much w you talking till 1 am 
	Working late tonight 
Ish:
	Rest = your pussy still sore‚Ä¶. Thats rest you need most of‚Ä¶. You say your experienced and all, but you‚Äôve NEVER experienced what I bring and that s the honest truth
Sherma:
	You make me crack a smile 
	Am not even laughing 
Ish:
	You know its true, thats why
	My lady is sooooo satisfied and it makes me very happy knowing that
Sherma:
	The way you think is hilarious 
Ish:
	Do you like it? Does it get boring? Does it turn you on?
Sherma:
	It's ite

Ish:

Sherma:
	Never heard that one before 
Ish:
	The saying goes one man‚Äôs trash ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. I just improvised with gutter
	I like to improvise whether in talk or the bedroom, thats why you‚Äôll never be able to handle either
Sherma:
	File Transfer: IMG_2343.PNG
Ish:
	wtf
Sherma:
	What u think about her ?
	As a man you think that's sexy ? And would you wanna tap that ?
Ish:
	I only have üëÄ for you.
Sherma:
	Am asking 
Ish:
	I‚Äôm not answering that question sounds like a setup
Sherma:
	Be honest 
	No I swear 
	No setup 
Ish:
	Is that the girl your husband cheated you on with?
Sherma:
	Yup 
Ish:
	Who‚Äôs predictable?
Sherma:
	Am asking 
Ish:
	I know her, she‚Äôs my nieces friend
Sherma:
	Nope 
Ish:
	You got me was kidding
Sherma:
	I think he so fucking downgraded 
	But that could be my ego 
Ish:
	She‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt look like much substance to me‚Ä¶ maybe its the pic but its pretty obvious why he cheated with her
Sherma:
	Not obvious to me , do share 
Ish:
	Cuz he could and he thought he‚Äôd not get caught
	She seems the type that is both manipulative and can be manipulated easy pickings for any sub-successful male
	If he worked for her, he wouldn‚Äôt have a chance ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ matter of fact any person who works under her isn‚Äôt gonna get her attention longer then a minute
	But what do I know
	sub = semi
Sherma:
	She worked for his dad's company 
Ish:
	Of course
	And you needed family counseling‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. not trying to be mean‚Ä¶.. just saying‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Get over it is all I‚Äôm saying
	No different IMO a nurse hooking up with a Dr
	Other factors involved the chemistry and commonality is what I‚Äùm saying
	the =then
Sherma:
	The get over it was not mean but the nurse crack was a little 
Ish:
	Truth hurts‚Ä¶.if not true then its not mean
	Woman hooking up with Men in power isn‚Äôt something new all i‚Äôm trying to say
	Its not gonna be a Nicholas Spark novel plot
Sherma:
	Okay it's different in my case, it was the clique and not the power 
	A dr is just a tittle, he is just Chris 
Ish:
	of course‚Ä¶.must be something else if you like him more then me
Sherma:
	Ir he could be anyone else 
Ish:
	Without a doubt‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
Sherma:
	I told you I'm not a materialist person 
	I don't care about shit like other people 
Ish:
	Yeah mrs platinum and michael kore and blah blah blah
	You don‚Äôt care at all, cmon!!! Never give me any credit or ever tell me about your feelings puhlease!!!
	I work every day and only get paid once in a while‚Ä¶.. smh 
	Totally underpaid!! Admit that
Sherma:
	Didn't get the last part ??
Ish:
	It means I should be getting laid more then once a week‚Ä¶ I work the day should get laid/paid that day‚Ä¶. not only 1 day payment for 7 days work
Sherma:
	Wtf 
	Work on what ?
	Get outta here 
Ish:
	Work = spend time with you! I give you quality time‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ I should be rewarded is all I‚Äôm saying‚Ä¶. rewarded with the real thing!!
	If shouldn‚Äôt have to work so hard to get what I‚Äôve earned is all I‚Äôm trying to say
	If = I
	A man with my skills should get sex anytime‚Ä¶. not just compliments anytime
Sherma:
	I hate the word "work", you just lost me :( 
Ish:
	How do you feel about the word ‚Äúhate‚Äù you just used?
	So I‚Äôm even more lost then you 
Sherma:
	It's warranted in this instance 
	It's past despise 
Ish:
	Cmon!!! Who‚Äôs the hypocrite
Sherma:
	I'm sorry 
	Thought I could slip that one in 
	Without you noticing 
	Fucker 
Ish:
	I enjoy working for or with you ‚Ä¶. no reason to ‚Äúhate‚Äù or despise
	Just trying to be cute and push buttons  you said yourself pushing my buttons is like foreplay just trying to do the same
Sherma:
	I rather you kiss me 
	Than push my buttons 
Ish:
	Can‚Äôt kiss 40 miles away‚Ä¶. duh
	You want me to come visit you at work? I‚Äôm sure you know all the places to mess around there smh
Sherma:
	I won't want you to have the same experiences 
	Work is not an option 
Ish:
	I‚Äôm just kidding
	You glossed over my comment earlier about my statement saying you like the dr more then me‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Any truth in my statement?
Sherma:
	Stop being a wet blanket 
Ish:
	You are by not answering the question
	Set the record straight plz
	Stop being shady my lady
Sherma:
	Take the fifth
Ish:
	Not acceptable
Sherma:
	It's been 6 weeks
	Cmon
	Cut me some slack 
Ish:
	It was only 3 months with the Dr
Sherma:
	4 months together 
	2 1/2 years knowing him 
Ish:
	8 months you been un-together correct?
	I‚Äôm not asking if your feel more for me then him when you were together, I‚Äôm asking about today!!!
	Thats a totally fair question
	So are you saying you‚Äôd rather if you could choose you‚Äôd rather spend this weekend with him then me? Cuz you knew him for 2  year and were together for 4 months?
	So are you saying you‚Äôd rather if you  spend this weekend with him then me? Cuz you knew him for 2  year and were together for 4 months?
	I thinks its more legible now hopefully
Sherma:
	You always stick me in a corner when you ask questions 
Ish:
	No corner if your honest
	I‚Äôm not giving you an ultimatum and you know no matter what you answer is gonna change us
Sherma:
	Why is it important to you ?
	If but changes nothing 
	If it 
Ish:
	Cuz it is important and you speak about honesty how important it is‚Ä¶. I want you to walk it not talk it
	I don‚Äôt dance around your questions
	Stop üíÉüèª
Sherma:
	Are you giving me an ultimatum ?
Ish:
	nope
	But I want an answer‚Ä¶. and you will answer it‚Ä¶.. otherwise you make a mountain out of a mole hill
	The answer means less then the fact you won‚Äôt answer in all honesty, why you think its such a big deal is a bit weird
Sherma:
	I don't like having to chose you or him 
Ish:
	So its a tie?
Sherma:
	I'm sure you don't even remember the question 
	Could you just be you 
Ish:
	The real question is who you like more?
	Today!
	Would  you rather spend this weekend with him then me?
Sherma:
	Today I like you more , 
Ish:
	No question?
Sherma:
	Would¬†¬†you rather spend this weekend with him?? I don't know bcuz I haven't seen him in a while 
	I won't want to be with you and think of him 
Ish:
	I wanna spend the weekend with you only you‚Ä¶. Life isn‚Äôt that fucken complicated unless you make it
	So then it‚Äôs obvious you like me more then him! Thanks for admitting the truth
	Clear victory for me!
	Correct?
Sherma:
	I like you Artie or else I won't be with you 
Ish:
	and your heart is mine, not anyones else‚Äôs (for this month), correct?
Sherma:
	Yes 
Ish:
	No other person in world (besides skrillez) you‚Äôd rather see then me, correct?
Sherma:
	Correct 
Ish:
	Why was that soooooo difficult to say?
	Are you lying to me?
Sherma:
	I'm yours, all yours for this month 
Ish:
	Bullshit answer!
	Thats a wet fucken blanket
	Hypocrite
Sherma:
	It's not 
	I don't know what you want me to say ?
	How the fuck am I a hypocrite 
Ish:
	All you had to say was I‚Äôm not lying
	You don‚Äôt like when I‚Äôm a wet blanket yet you  become one
	Thats‚Äô the hypocrite statement
Sherma:
	I am not lying 
	Shish 
Ish:
	It‚Äôs bullshit how you can spend all this time with me and not categorically deny some dude you haven‚Äôt been with in 8 months
	The fact you have to think about answering is comical
Sherma:
	Do you derive some kind of insane pleasure putting the fucking screws in me 
Ish:
	The truth is he don‚Äôt compare to men(you care more for me)‚Ä¶.. whether you wanna believe that or not ‚Ä¶. thats the TRUTH!!! And I‚Äôm just preparing you for that before you realize it too late and get 
	The screws you put in‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm trying to remove them from your mind‚Ä¶. you need to let go and stop feeling guilty about nonsense
	If your precious Dr or any other of your ex‚Äôs ‚Ä¶.. or any sane human watched the tape of us‚Ä¶. it would be crystal clear to them what your true feelings are‚Ä¶ LOL‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm just pointing out the obvious (not to steal your word, lol!)
	The fact you don‚Äôt admit it and elevate me is beyond Stubborn!
Sherma:
	Why do you fight with me so fucking much ?
Ish:
	Your sooo wrong my lady ....... It's Foreplayüòç
Sherma:
	It was definitely enough for you to cum 
	Twice at least 
Ish:
	Not with you and your god damn wet blankets
Sherma:
	Stop asking fucking questions
	Btw I do recall saying you like it wet 
	So who's the hypocrite, just saying 
Ish:
	Different contexts my lady‚Ä¶.. I like you wet‚Ä¶ but wasn‚Äôt crazy about sleeping on the wet side of the bed you stuck me with 
Sherma:
	Sorry 
	I'm sure it's not a pleasant place to be 
	Next time stay on top of me 
Ish:
	I would if you drop all your exes
Sherma:
	It's me me telling you drop all your friends for me 
	That won't be fair 
Ish:
	Not saying that
	Say I‚Äôm #1 is what I mean you can still talk to them I told you I‚Äôm not jealous type
	Just want respect thats all
Sherma:
	I never treated you like #2
	And I do respect you 
Ish:
	been treating me like #3 actually
Sherma:
	How so ???
Ish:
	Really
	Fine I‚Äôll be too happy to explain
	You dumped me saying you incapable cuz of you husband and how he hurt you ‚Ä¶ That 1
	#2 - Is you clearly  stated other day that your mad love for Dr is affecting you committing to me
	Do you need me to repost my proof - post you stated 
	?
	That makes me 3 !
Sherma:
	Okay .. Husband is a non factor
	Cross him off the list 
Ish:
	Not true you stated going thru divorce and stuff makes you incapable 
Sherma:
	I said I'm dealing with lots of conflicting feeling 
Ish:
	Do I need to repost your dear john text?
Sherma:
	Not love or me being in love with him 
Ish:
	He still has you #1 priority obviously
	When  you dumped me it wasn‚Äôt stated you love him but he‚Äôs higher priority according to you? Sorry I can‚Äôt pick n choose like you what you say is accurate and whats‚Äô inaccurate
Sherma:
	Quite frankly, you're not going through a divorce. No clue what I'm going thru from day to day 
	And it has nothing to do with love but me wanting to figure out how to have a life 
	Never plan on being divorce but here I am 
	My children comes 1st 
	Chris may have taken that 2nd place for now 
	But you were not suppose to be part of the equation 
	And here you are 
Ish:
	yup
	Give me my due and respect all I ask
Sherma:
	I think I treat you fairly 
	I'm doing the best I can 
Ish:
	Then just say it stop denying the fact ..... Other then your kids I'm clearly #1 no question way ahead of any other pretender 
	Case closed! 
	I‚Äôve earned that designation!
	Don‚Äôt belong in same sentence as any of the others‚Ä¶.. otherwise I feel disrespected
	Remember when I went on my vow of silence and we didn‚Äôt speak for 2 whole days?  Remember that?
Sherma:
	Yea
Ish:
	How often you go 2 days without speaking to the good ole dr?
Sherma:
	We had different kind of fights 
Ish:
	Thats not my question
Sherma:
	Close to 2 days 
Ish:
	How often you go 2 days without speaking to the good ole dr?
	Texting counts as speaking obviously
Sherma:
	It's kindda hard to say 
	Talk to him couple times a week 
Ish:
	Thank you ‚Ä¶ So its quite often you don‚Äôt speak for a few days
	Do you want me to stop talking to you for 2 days again to remind you how it felt?
Sherma:
	That depends on what you want to do 
Ish:
	Of course I don‚Äôt want to do that, but if you don‚Äôt think theres a major difference from not talking to me for a few days and not talking to dr‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. I‚Äôll do it
	And another thing, while we at it‚Ä¶. How you gonna say you speak to this guy every few days and then say there was no closure?? WTF, what you guys talk about !!! SMFH
	Denial? WOW
Sherma:
	Could you drop it 
Ish:
	Would love to‚Ä¶.. just drop him below me‚Ä¶.. I‚Äôm fine!
	Besides family who‚Äôs #1?
Sherma:
	File Transfer: IMG_0680.png
	Go away 
Ish:
	Cute‚Ä¶ but I‚Äùm not accepting jokes and dancing 
	Your not gonna answer?
Sherma:
	I am #1
	Besides family 
Ish:
	And‚Ä¶..
Sherma:
	STOP !!
Ish:
	Nope‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ answer the question‚Ä¶. You stop making this a big deal
Sherma:
	You fight w me every step of the way and you still wanna be with me 
Ish:
	WHo‚Äôs #2?
	And how do you speak with someone and not have closure with them, smh‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Sorry I‚Äôm not interested in a bunch of going thru motions nonsense
Sherma:
	Arthur you like me, yes ?
	You care about me , yea ?
Ish:
	Yup
Sherma:
	You're no way close to being in love with me, stop fighting with me 
Ish:
	Don‚Äôt tell me my feelings‚Ä¶. please!
	I want the truth‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. just say it
	Who‚Äôs #2?
Sherma:
	It is not important, you are not into me where you require an answer 
Ish:
	LOL‚Ä¶ You don‚Äôt know that‚Ä¶ stop it
Sherma:
	I do know that 
Ish:
	Know you don‚Äôt
	You don‚Äôt know shit!
	Worry about yourself and stop fighting me
	What kinda bs is it ‚Ä¶. to be intimate with someone and not being to able to get an answer to a simple question
Sherma:
	Every person you've fucked where you into them ??
Ish:
	Your not every person‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Im into you‚Ä¶. or I wouldn‚Äôt ask 
	Who‚Äôs #2?
Sherma:
	You're right, you were into me, 6 times in one night 
Ish:
	Correct and you still won‚Äôt make me #2, how sad is that?
Sherma:
	You all done 
Ish:
	Yup
	GN
Sherma:
	Really 
Ish:
	Nothing else to talk about
	You want me to be like your dr talk about nonsense‚Ä¶.
	Foreplay killed sorry
Sherma:
	So you blew up my phone to fight with me 
Ish:
	Go have foreplay with him
	We blow up each others phone every day what you talking about
Sherma:
	I don't fight to keep anyone 
Ish:
	This isn‚Äôt a fight to keep anyone‚Ä¶ all it is a simple question
	I‚Äôm sure if you asked me a question and wanted an honest answer and I kept refusing you wouldn‚Äôt be happy either
	Who‚Äôs #2?
Sherma:
	GN Artie 
Ish:
	Stop being a coward and answer the question
	Its not fair to me not to answer the question
	I‚Äôm serious about this‚Ä¶. I want an answer
	Who‚Äôs #2? Your made this such a big deal stop it
	The fact you won‚Äôt answer is a million times worse then not answering
	What you say early on‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt care about someone telling me worst thing imaginable‚Ä¶. but lying I can never forgive
	I feel your being shady with me by not answering
	And borderline lying and disingenuous by not answering
	Who‚Äôs #2?
	You claim to be fair to me and respectful‚Ä¶ how can that be if you don‚Äôt answer a simple question
	Who‚Äôs #2?
	You there?
Sherma:
	Hi.. I guess I understand your frustration, I would also be pissed if the situation was reversed. Direct quote from you" action speaks louder than words". What does my action say?? 
From the jump I said that whatever this is, I do not want to label it.  As simple as the question is, I can't answer it probably bcuz I have difficulty expressing how I feel hence the reason for zero labels. 
	I'm not shady or disingenuous the way you stated it. Just unable to say what you wanna hear
Ish:
	ok ill accept that! ill drop it! Did you sleep ok?
Sherma:
	Hold on 
	Not much, got home around 2. Trains were messed up 
Ish:

Sherma:

Sherma:

Ish:

Sherma:
	When do you stop meeting with him ? 
Ish:
	You'll be long gone by then I'll be a distant memory 
	Another 2 years most likely up to 4 if bad behavior 
	Only meet 1 time a month
Sherma:
	How long ?
Ish:
	How long what?  Almost 8 inches
Sherma:
	WIth PO 
	I already know the size of you dick 
	You've answered both 
Ish:
	Ok... My lady have any other questions ?
Sherma:
	Thank you 
Ish:
	Anytime 
Sherma:
	Did you refer to me as ur gf?
Ish:
	You figure it out
Sherma:
	 Ok, don't rough me up, I'm tired 
	Be gentle 
Ish:
	I am gentle your the one stirring stuff up not me
	You get home yet or still on train?
Sherma:
	On train 
Ish:
	Ok‚Ä¶.. I‚Äôll be gentler‚Ä¶ Whats you trying to do?
Sherma:
	Dunno yet 
	But will tell u when I know 
Ish:
	What I meant is why you instigating with the GF question?
	Better question‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.How did it make you feel when I told you to be a better girlfriend?
Sherma:
	Was just asking? You call me you lady !!
Ish:
	ok‚Ä¶ But if I told you to be a better lady context couldve be confusing
	could‚Äôve = would‚Äôve
Sherma:
	Guess so 
Ish:
	How did it make you feel when I told you to be a better girlfriend?
	üíÉüèª again?
Sherma:
	The question posed make me think that you consider yourself as my boyfriend 
	That's kindda weird for me to say 
	Strange maybe 
Ish:
	Is it wrong for me to consider myself that?
	I‚Äôm not angry at all fwiw‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm not trying to pick a fight
Sherma:
	We really haven't talk about it 
Ish:
	What are we doing now?
	Is it wrong for me to consider myself that?
Sherma:
	We're seeing each other, don't know if heat means we are cuffed 
	Heat= that
	I don't bring anything positive in your life 
Ish:
	Yes you do‚Ä¶ many positive things
	Definition of boyfriend on google 1. a regular male companion with whom one has a romantic or sexual relationship.
	Cuffed‚Ä¶. you sure aren‚Äôt‚Ä¶ You have 2 boyfriends maybe 3 sounds like to me
	I‚Äôm definitely not cuffing you‚Ä¶. lol
Sherma:
	For me the idea of a boyfriend is more so for teenagers. When you've been married before then I would refer to it as seeing someone 
	If you wanna go of google them yea, you're my boyfriend 
	Am I not cuffing material ?
Ish:
	I think so‚Ä¶ but you won‚Äôt commit or cuff to me
	You rather have 3 boyfriends, me, brooklyn nurse, and Dr Cali
Sherma:
	The only one I've been bedding is you 
Ish:
	Thank you! It means a lot‚Ä¶. but your obviously still romantically involved with Dr and you who knows what kinda stuff goes on with Brooklyn fella‚Ä¶.. Romantic relationship can mean a lot of things was more or less my point with other 2 
	But I‚Äôm happy to put the ‚ÄúSexual‚Äù in my boyfriend title with you
	But the romantic part with possibly other people is the reason I feel you don‚Äôt wanna be cuffed to me  IMHO
	Still miss talking to me , LOL?
	üòòüíÉüèªüòú
Sherma:
	It's important for you to say what's on your mind 
	Btw.. I just walked in 
	I'm home 
Ish:
	Glad you home
	Your the one stirring the pot on the GF reference not me
Sherma:
	Too tired to cook 
Ish:
	Your the troublemaker not me, lol
Sherma:
	Me ??
Ish:
	Yup
Sherma:
	I don't see how 
Ish:
	Not going there, not gonna make a comment about my 3 boyfriend argument
	Taking the 5th again?
Sherma:
	You're still on it ??
	Zees
	Jeez
Ish:
	Ohhhh, you state I just walked in and conversation ends
	I get it!
Sherma:
	Just wanted you to know I got home 
Ish:
	And don‚Äôt comment on my previous statements 
	By the google definition of ‚Äúboyfriend‚Äù‚Ä¶.. How many boyfriends does Sherma Rayan have?
Sherma:
	They all mean different things to me. My friend from b'lyn, I love him and would do anything for him but not in love with him
Ish:
	And the other?
Sherma:
	Cali, I fell in love with but never told him. I don't know if there will ever be a future there based on long distance
Ish:
	u done?
Sherma:
	You, I'm getting to know, it's a process. You came out from nowhere and there's something between us. You drive me nuts half the time but I still look forward to talking to you and being with you. Only time will tell where it leads 
	I enjoy being with you Artie 
	You make me laugh and happy, most of the time 
	I'm done now 
Ish:
	Thx‚Ä¶. When I posted the ‚Äúu done‚Äù question was premature sorry I didn‚Äôt mean to interrupt
	Do you thinks it possible for you to be ‚Äúin love‚Äù with any of your ex‚Äôs and still care as much as you do for me?
	Care = talk as much, sex as much - us being us
Sherma:
	I've never been in a situation like this so I can't in all honestly answer it 
	But you did say it's possible to be in love w two people at the same time 
Ish:
	I said its possible for me‚Ä¶.lol
	But ‚Äúin love‚Äù and ‚Äútrue love‚Äù are different levels
	But enough of the ‚ÄúL‚Äù talk‚Ä¶. What time you going to bed? I‚Äôm happy to hear your off tomorrow ‚Ä¶. you could use a day off after week you just went thru at hospital
	You ever watch the show ‚ÄúLucifer‚Äù?
Sherma:
	Bed now 
	Thz 
Ish:
	anytime! Like how I adopted your word? I know you notice that
Sherma:
	Shish 
	Just wanna say that there's nothing as true love 
Ish:
	I disagree
Sherma:
	True love meaning it last forever 
	Nothing is 
	People die, people leave 
Ish:
	Lets drop it! Your jaded that‚Äôs all
	You get to sleep in 2moro?
Sherma:
	:((
	Not jaded 
	Artie, thank you 
Ish:
	Not jaded‚Ä¶. just self proclaimed ‚Äúincapable‚Äù
	Thank you for what exactly?
Sherma:
	Keeping me company at 
	From work to home 
Ish:
	Anytime
Sherma:
	Good night my lord 
Ish:

Sherma:
	Hi
	I got like 15 mins to kill 
Ish:
	Ok! 
	What you wanna fight about oops i mean talk about ?
Sherma:
	I'm a lover not a fighter 
Ish:
	Once a week or so  correct 
Sherma:
	Yup
	Once every 8 days to be exact 
Ish:
	Really every 10 days you have yet to put out in 8 days we will find out 2moro on that 
Sherma:
	Lol
	Should be happy just to have me in your presence 
Ish:
	I am..... Not complaining
	Moderation is one thing but once every 10 days is outright ridiculous IMHO 
Sherma:
	Shish 
	Shish 
Ish:
	And on top of it you only commit a month 
Sherma:
	Shish 
Ish:
	It's all good! Not complaining 
	You want honesty and truth and I definitely enjoy giving you what u want
Sherma:
	I'm sure you find true delight and pleasure 
Ish:
	Over and over land over again until you break/tap
	Land = and
	I believe the pleasure and delight are mutually beneficial 
Sherma:
	Possibly 
Ish:
	You cant get enough plz! 
Sherma:
	Haha
	That's the reason I come thru after 10 days 
	Can't keep my hands off of you

Sherma:

	??
	Whoa 
Ish:
	Yes you can't handle the sex not used to my stamina 
	My size, experience and stamina is too much 
	Your body needs 8-10 days of rest 
Sherma:

Sherma:
	Why would you stay that ?
Ish:
	It's true
Sherma:
	We have really good chemistry 
Ish:
	You touch urself when u text the good ole dr
Sherma:
	I touch myself all the time 
	I'm someone that had a lot of toys and shit
Ish:
	Dr know this? He use them on u
	Do you guys have sexual texts and stuff in last 8 months?
	Cyber sex or what have u
	Some people consider that cheating 
	I don't 
Sherma:
	Good to know 
	Not gonna get into talking about sex w others tonight 
	Don't wanna fight, just wanna see you tomorrow and have a good time 
Ish:
	So you do have cyber sex with the dr and shit
	You are full of surprises my lady 
	GN get some rest for tommorrow
Sherma:
	Why u leaving 
Ish:
	You don't wanna fight 
	And I'm not gonna start something and then change the subject
Sherma:
	Nope , don't wanna get into anything heavy with you 
Ish:
	Not happening don't drop 1 shoe then not then not drop other
	So u and dr have text sex or whatever last 8 months since August correct ?
	Every few days .... Do u FaceTime eachother?
Sherma:
	This will line of questioning will get you no where 
	It will create conflict for tomorrow 
Ish:
	Then tell me truth 
Sherma:
	Don't pursue it plZ
Ish:
	I'm fine with truth 
	Do u do webcams for him?
Sherma:
	I don't like going to bed upset 
Ish:
	I'm fine with tommorrow 
Sherma:
	So could we not 
Ish:
	What's wrong with telling me the truth 
	I told u I don't get jealous
	I will still be excited for tommorrow regardless
Sherma:
	Don't get jealous but you get piss
Ish:
	That ego you always criticize won't allow me to be affected
	Pissed only I'm not #1
	More I know why I'm not #1 only helps
	And it helps in a month when u leave to know why
	Truth is truth u of all people should respect that
Sherma:
	We did that entire thing on Wednesday night 
	Been there. Done that 
	Don't wanna revisit it w you 
Ish:
	So is it safe to say my lady isn't have orgasms with a man 3k miles away 
	No masturbating with him or nothing am I the only person making u cum in last month?
	No web cam no FaceTime sexual shit either
Sherma:
	Shish 
	Could we talk bout tomorrow ?
Ish:
	Sherma cmon!
	I'm a simple guy 1 or 2 positions kiss and fuck
	What u doing ?
Sherma:
	With whom ? 
	Nothing 
Ish:
	Nothing freaky with dr? No toys no FaceTime shit
	No cyber sec
Sherma:
	Next time I would remember not to mention my sexual desires 
Ish:
	Sex
	So being dishonest is how u gonna be
	I love ur sexual desires
	Just want em all for me I'm selfish 
	Two things unnatural for me 1. You say ur incapable and gonna dump me 2. Don't make me #1 man in ur life
	If something don't make sense it's not true IMO ---- I've stated this before 
	How can you and me 2 twins basically be on the outs ? 
Sherma:
	Goddamn you say a lot 
	Let it rock 
	If it ent broke don't fix it 
	Don't wanna argue or flight w you 
	So could we drop this for tonite 
	Going to tap now

Sherma:
	Very, thank you 
	Very much so .. Off to bed now 
	Thanks again and good nite 
Ish:
	Anytime .....Was just thinking about guess it was mutual 
	Good Afternoon!
Sherma:
	Hi got super busy at work 
Ish:
	np‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ busy now?
Sherma:
	Just got home 
	Nope he said he's coming back to ny  end of March. Honestly girl I don't know what's gonna happen  
Ish:
	Glad your home!  I think this was sent wrong place
Sherma:
	Clearly meant for my girlfriend 
	Sorry 
Ish:
	Np I understand sorry the cat came out of the bag better now then never I guess lol
	How did you Sleep? 
	Work went well?
Sherma:
	Work was actually really good today, got a lot done. 
	Sorry not much sleep, stayed up and watch the oscars 
	I wanted a little bit more time to figure things out before I say something 
	Chris is coming back 
Ish:
	Yup at end of march
	It explains a lot‚Ä¶. Makes things clearer now lol
	I understand now the 10th decree stuff and only a month commitment.  Sorry to complicate your life. 
	Believe it or not its more of a relief then anything‚Ä¶..not mad 1 bit at you
	Regardless, we still better be on for McGregor fight, you did commit already, and my lady is bound to her word, lol!!!üòá
Sherma:
	None of this I expected. I join tinder for conversation not to hook up. I met you and I had a great time, didn't have any expectations 
	I'm sorry never meant to hurt you if I did 
Ish:
	Only time I got hurt was when you tapped and that was only a few days and it was a pain not only from you dumping me but also from not understanding
	You came back‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ and we are good. I‚Äôm sorry if your plans got altered‚Ä¶.. You said yourself best plans get laid to rest or something like that
	I watched oscars too‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ I thought you said you were going to bed at 8pm or so
	I thought Chris Rock‚Äôs monologue was great!
	I also though he did overdue it a bit with all the race stuff after‚Ä¶
Sherma:
	Quite agreed 
Ish:
	I‚Äôd give him a B+
Sherma:
	B for me 
Ish:
	I was happy Leo finally won the oscar‚Ä¶.. But I wasn‚Äôt crazy about his global warming speech‚Ä¶..  but I give him credit for staying through with his role and not mentioning his personal happiness in finally winning
	Unfortunately I haven‚Äôt really watched any of the movies that were nominated‚Ä¶. although if you want I‚Äôd like to watch hateful8 with you before the fight on saturday if you want
	It was nice to see the old italian man win for best score‚Ä¶.. He did the score to that movie..
Sherma:
	Too late on hateful8, saw it yesterday at 3.45 
Ish:
	How was it?
Sherma:
	My friend was in a funk so we ended up going to see it 
	You would like it 
Ish:
	Did you like it?
Sherma:
	Yea I thought it was  really good 
Ish:
	Oh well‚Ä¶. you might have to see it again then 
Sherma:
	You're not mad at me , are you ?
Ish:
	Nope, if anything I empathize understanding better your thought process
	I‚Äôve always told you I have an uncanny ability to see both sides of an argument
	Off the top of my head I can‚Äôt remember if I ever asked when he‚Äôs coming back (I figure I must‚Äôve) but regardless it provides more clarity kinda surprised I didn‚Äôt figure it out myself earlier
Sherma:
	He told me about it  lastnite 
Ish:
	Ok‚Ä¶
	Wow, how did you feel when he told you?
Sherma:
	Question everything as usual 
	I also give him a hard time, you're not the only special one .. Lol
Ish:
	When did you expect him to come back?
Sherma:
	3rd week 
	Will book his flight this week 
Ish:
	Is he coming back for good? Or just visiting
Sherma:
	He signed up to do 3 yrs 
Ish:
	3 years in new york?
Sherma:
	Yup
Ish:
	He gonna be working with you in same Hospital?
Sherma:
	Yep
Ish:
	Wow
	You must be happy about that
Sherma:
	I don't express much excitement about anything 
	I have a tendency to downplay everything 
	You know how I do it ..
Ish:
	We still gonna hang this week?
Sherma:
	We can still watch the fight 
Ish:
	Overnight?
Sherma:
	Not sure bout that :(
Ish:
	Seriously!!
	You picking him over me
	?
Sherma:
	It's not a matter of picking him over you, he was always there
	But in the shadows 
Ish:
	Don‚Äôt understand what your saying?
	I‚Äôve asked you direct questions about him or all your other EX‚Äôs
	And you said he was an EX
	He sure wasn‚Äôt there Saturday night lol!
	Or Sunday morning
	You plan on meeting him at airport and jumping in his arms when he gets off plane?
Sherma:
	Depending on his flight I will be picking him up 
	Im too heavy to jump in his arms 
Ish:
	Your gonna fuck him?
	Amazing this is like Deja Vu with Ish all over again
	We didn‚Äôt text back then though
Sherma:
	I'm sorry 
Ish:
	It is what it is
	So your plan is to fuck him?
Sherma:
	I don't make plans , whatever happens 
Ish:
	If he wanted to , would you ?
Sherma:
	Probably yes 
	I don't know
Ish:
	So you care more for him then me?
Sherma:
	I care about you but I've been in love with him 
Ish:
	Thats not the question
	Do you care more for him then poor lil me?
Sherma:
	Don't speak about yourself like that 
Ish:
	I‚Äôm just kidding
	Cmon‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm not at all feeling sorry for myself
Sherma:
	Okay 
Ish:
	It‚Äôs actually a very interesting dilemma your in
	I‚Äôm finally gonna get answers to questions you‚Äôve been avoiding to answer
	I‚Äôve been trying hard to pin down that #1 spot‚Ä¶.. you thought it was just semantics, but in a few weeks it‚Äôs gonna get real! 
	We both like Truth‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ we will see who handles it better
	Soo‚Ä¶.. What‚Äôs our status now?
Sherma:
	Most likely be terminated because you don't do friends with women
Ish:
	So you are choosing him over  me?
Sherma:
	I'm still in love with him 
Ish:
	No your not
	You wouldn‚Äôt been with me if you were imo
	Habits are hard to break. but I‚Äôm not one to tell you , your feelings
	You‚Äôve never even told him you love him
	Most people tell people they don‚Äôt really love that they love them
	I‚Äôve told you I think you love me.
	Again, it‚Äôs your feelings, your soul, your body, etc. You do with it what‚Äôs best for you.
	But I‚Äôve asked you flat out‚Ä¶. who‚Äôs #1 and you never stated him, or me.    If you did love him you would‚Äôve should‚Äôve said him then,
	Then there‚Äôs no argument and I‚Äôd clearly be obligated to back o ff
	I gave you that out!
	You never took it!
	When you dumped me all you said was about how your divorce and all this other stuff about your ex husband and stuff you never mentioned this Dr guy as a reason
	Now he comes back and you expect it to be a formality I go away is kinda fucked up
Sherma:
	He left I didn't think he was coming back 
Ish:
	You told me he was gone for a year
Sherma:
	I told him that I dont believe in long distance 
Ish:
	You gonna tell him about me?
Sherma:
	Yes
Ish:
	Really?
	What you gonna tell him? I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it
	It‚Äôs honorable you would but I‚Äôm not the kind of guy to send emails or anything like that
	I wouldn‚Äôt sabotage you if he‚Äôs what you really want
Sherma:
	I won't be able to look at him and lie 
Ish:
	You gonna tell him before or after he arrives?
Sherma:
	The truth is important 
	After 
Ish:
	After the bedding ceremony? lol
Sherma:
	Probably before 
Ish:
	You and your probably‚Äôs smh
	So we not gonna do it anymore?
Sherma:
	Nope we can't 
Ish:
	that‚Äôs bullshit, we still have a few weeks
	You are choosing him over me then?
	I won‚Äôt lie, that hurts‚Ä¶
	No more kisses either if we watch the McGregor fight together?
Sherma:
	Kissing leads to more shit, better not
Ish:
	All cuz he‚Äôs returning? No more romance with us
	So please for the record, state I‚Äôm #2 and he‚Äôs #1. Thanks 
	Until you say Artie your behind the Dr. - I won‚Äôt accept it
Sherma:
	My lord you were so close, you came in 2nd to him 
	I won't forget you 
Ish:
	I know thats what the tattoos for
	Whatever Sherma‚Ä¶.. I had less time only reason i‚Äôm not way ahead imho, instead of just a lil bit
	Besides, when you tell him about me , you‚Äôll finally be able to tell him you love him
	See ‚Ä¶ I dated this great guy blah blah blah and when I realized you were coming back i ended it with so and so cuz I love you!
	Happily ever after! Just upsets me after the weekend we just had how quickly you know I‚Äôm #2
	It is what it is! 
	I‚Äôll need time to think and take it all in
Sherma:
	I'm sorry 
Ish:
	Not sure if seeing the McGregor fight is a good idea yet with you
	Sorry doesn‚Äôt cut it lol
	But if thats what your heart says‚Ä¶. not your mind who am I to stand in the way
	Amazed how quickly you decided I was #2.
	Not sure if that text that let cat out of bag was a good thing or bad thing
Sherma:
	I would have told you about if the moment he confirmed his flight 
Ish:
	I didn‚Äôt think it was that clear cut for you‚Ä¶ but in the end you want to know if it‚Äôs real or not‚Ä¶ and what better way to know then this
	I still don‚Äôt believe it yet‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ kinda surreal but ultimately its up to you 
Sherma:
	I swear I never meant to hurt you in any way 
Ish:
	I know that
	I know you didn‚Äôt want to hurt me or hurt yourself, trust me you‚Äôll hurt from this as well
	But you atleast have your #1, so good for you 
Sherma:
	These past 2 weekends was great 
Ish:
	Part of me thinks its cuz he‚Äôs in love with you and your not sure my true feelings so you feel more obligated to him
	He‚Äôs the safer bet and he‚Äôs had more time with you.
	I‚Äôll always leave the door open a crack for you lol
	If you realize I‚Äôm #1 don‚Äôt be shy
	I‚Äôm not gonna hold my breath
Sherma:
	You won't be able to give 100% to someone else, close the door on me
Ish:
	Past 2 weekends were great. Not great enough I guess
	I‚Äôm not 100% so it don‚Äôt matter lol
Sherma:
	Thank you Artie 
	For everything 
Ish:
	Sure. Your really ending it this abruptly, wow
Sherma:
	Spending time with you was awesome
Ish:
	I‚Äôll admit I wasn‚Äôt prepared for this
	You 100% sure we‚Äôre done?
	Do you believe you could say this to me in Person?
Sherma:
	We are, he's coming back 
	This time I would have done it in person 
Ish:
	When?
	When you wanna meet?
Sherma:
	There's no reason to tell you in person because we are doing it now 
Ish:
	lol
	Really, damn you want this to be so easy
Sherma:
	But the moment Chris confirmed his flight I would have met with you in the city and told you 
Ish:
	Wow so mean about it
Sherma:
	Didn't want to drag it out further 
	I never wanted to hurt you, believe me 
	I was on cloud 9 this weekend 
Ish:
	Likewise
	So if your on cloud 9 this weekend how can it be over on Monday
	What about actions over words?
	Remember that
Sherma:
	One word only, Chris 
	He changed everything 
Ish:
	You stated if I played guitar I‚Äôd have your heart forever
Sherma:
	He reeled me in with music 
	And I think I somehow I was trying to replace him 
Ish:
	Nope
	I asked you before if Dr was flying in would u cancel our date and you said probably not 
	Puhlease 
	I reacted you said probably not never and now u end it now cuz of him cmon
	I think you need some time to think about it 
	It's a lot no question that happened 
	And you should atleast be open to seeing me again 
	You committed to mcgregor fight already
Sherma:
	I can't see you after knowing Chris is coming back. It won't be fair 
Ish:
	Fair to who?
Sherma:
	He would ask if I saw you !!
	After I knew he was comin back 
Ish:
	Ok
Sherma:
	Whatever I did when he was gone he might forgive 
Ish:
	So no mcgregor fight then?
Sherma:
	Seeing you won't be the best idea right now 
Ish:
	Chris didn't buy the fact that I let him go becuz I was falling for him, he thought I use him to get over my husband
	That's ur text to me other day u said that's wasn't true
	Also said this - Artie I'm sorry but if I  see you I won't be able to walk away. Don't make it harder for either one of us, please. Let it go
	Your sure doing a great job walking lol
Sherma:
	This is not easy for me 
Ish:
	Reason U shouldn't take ur time 
Sherma:
	There's no victory here 
Ish:
	U get ur dr - perfect ending perfect love story
	You are discounting us
	100%
Sherma:
	I'm in love with him Artie , I can't discount that 
Ish:
	Sherma:
I spend countless hours with you 
Ish:
Helloooo wasn't that my point in my tantrums you detest so much 
Sherma:
Not with Chris or Denny but you 
Ish:
Okay and??
Sherma:
Okay , never mind 
Thank you for today

	Ish comes up as me in this thread
	Right there was a telling sign I was #1 IMHO
	Stop! With the I‚Äôm ‚Äúin love with him‚Äù stuff
	It doesn‚Äôt hold up when I asked you countless times and you never said it 
	‚Äúin love‚Äù and ‚Äúi was in love‚Äù are different
	If you were in love with Dr I‚Äôd have never progressed so quickly with mrs stubbornness
	No doubt!
	You can‚Äôt be in love with someone and never tell them and fuck another mans brains out 
	Some woman probably could but your not that type
	No way no how! We twins remember
	That‚Äôs what can‚Äôt be discounted lol
	I‚Äôm in the lead no question
	Whether I give up my lead is something I have to think about
	But its not something I can in 24 hours and you mrs cerebral hell no can either
Sherma:
	It's minuscule but all I can say is that I'm sorry 
	I got to pick up my daughter at the station 
	And going to bed right after 
Ish:
	No more texts anymore for us?
Sherma:
	It's a lot to digest
Ish:
	I agree
Sherma:
	Let me go 
Ish:
	What do you mean?
	Forever or just tonite?
Sherma:
	Both .. But I have to leave to get my daughter now 
Ish:
	Never say forever
	I won‚Äôt let you go‚Ä¶. but I‚Äôll let you do whatever you want
	There is a difference
	If I let ish go forever I wouldn‚Äôt have Ashton
	I never give up but I‚Äôm not insane will give in 
	So you don‚Äôt want me texting you ever again? 
	Killing off your twin ?
	Never gonna lay eyes on each other again?
Sherma:
	You need time to process all of this 
	Take care always 
	I really have to go 
	File Transfer: IMG_0813.PNGTruly I am, can't say it enough
	File Transfer: IMG_0813.PNGTruly I am, can't say it enough
Ish:
	Like u said I need time ! (You might need to) . You dream turned into my nightmare. I understand you said no commitment and everything but I honestly never took it seriously since your actions said otherwise 
	I believed u might see this dream of yours could be a nightmare as well. I guess time will tell
	Artie:
You glossed over my comment earlier about my statement saying you like the dr more then me‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Any truth in my statement?
Sherma:
Stop being a wet blanket 
The real #1 said:
You are by not answering the question
Set the record straight plz
Stop being shady my lady
Sherma:
Take the fifth
The real #1 said:
Not acceptable
Sherma:
It's been 6 weeks
Cmon
Cut me some slack 
The real #1 said:
It was only 3 months with the Dr
Sherma:
4 months together 
2 1/2 years knowing him 
The real #1 said:
8 months you been un-together correct?
I‚Äôm not asking if your feel more for me then him when you were together, I‚Äôm asking about today!!!
Thats a totally fair question
So are you saying you‚Äôd rather if you could choose you‚Äôd rather spend this weekend with him then me? Cuz you knew him for 2  year and were together for 4 months?
So are you saying you‚Äôd rather if you  spend this weekend with him then me? Cuz you knew him for 2  year and were together for 4 months?
I thinks its more legible now hopefully
Sherma:
You always stick me in a corner when you ask questions 
The real #1 said:
No corner if your honest
I‚Äôm not giving you an ultimatum and you know no matter what you answer is gonna change us
Sherma:
Why is it important to you ?
If but changes nothing 
If it 
The real #1 said:
Cuz it is important and you speak about honesty how important it is‚Ä¶. I want you to walk it not talk it
I don‚Äôt dance around your questions
Stop üíÉüèª
Sherma:
Are you giving me an ultimatum ?
The real #1 said:
nope
But I want an answer‚Ä¶. and you will answer it‚Ä¶.. otherwise you make a mountain out of a mole hill
The answer means less then the fact you won‚Äôt answer in all honesty, why you think its such a big deal is a bit weird
Sherma:
I don't like having to chose you or him 
Ish:
So its a tie?
Sherma:
I'm sure you don't even remember the question 
Could you just be you 
Ish:
The real question is who you like more?
Today!
Would  you rather spend this weekend with him then me?
Sherma:
Today I like you more , 
The real #1 said:
No question?
Sherma:
Would¬†¬†you rather spend this weekend with him?? I don't know bcuz I haven't seen him in a while 
I won't want to be with you and think of him 
The real #1 said:
I wanna spend the weekend with you only you‚Ä¶. Life isn‚Äôt that fucken complicated unless you make it
So then it‚Äôs obvious you like me more then him! Thanks for admitting the truth
Clear victory for me!
Correct?
Sherma:
I like you Artie or else I won't be with you 
and your heart is mine, not anyones else‚Äôs (for this month), correct?
Sherma:
Yes

	and your heart is mine, not anyones else‚Äôs (for this month), correct?
Sherma:
Yes
	The real#1 said:                   and your heart is mine, not anyones else‚Äôs (for this month), correct?
Sherma:
Yes
	Not beating a dead horse‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. but this was discussed recently , and it wasn‚Äôt so clear cut then and it should be today
	should = shouldn‚Äôt
	Read the thread and think‚Ä¶. don‚Äôt respond to this‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll leave you alone for a while ‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs all there and foreshadows a lot. Damn I‚Äôm good! GN!
	For the record to translate‚Ä¶.. That day you stated you liked me more! And didn‚Äôt know if you like him better since you haven‚Äôt spent time with him in a while!  I‚Äôm #1!
